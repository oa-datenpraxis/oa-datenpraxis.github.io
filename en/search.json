Furthermore, it shows that most of the column values are of data type character (chr), the publication year column values are of type integer (int), some of the open access column values are of type logical (lgl) and the apc column values are of type list (list). The output also indicates the first values of every column on the right hand side.\nThe first values show us two important things:\n\nThere are at least some missing values within our data frame as is indicated by the NA in the license and version columns. NA is not a common string or numeric value, but a reserved word in R for the logical constant which contains a missing value indicator, i.e. R uses NA to indicate that the specific value is missing.\nThe apc column contains data frames as values.

We will explore later in the notebook how to transform the column and access the apc information.\n\nTo look at the first 10 rows of our data frame we are using the head function.\n\nhead(df, 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 19\n   id         title doi   publication_year is_oa is_oa_anywhere oa_status oa_url\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 https://o… SARS… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           bronze    https…\n 2 https://o… IDF … http…             2021 FALSE TRUE           green     https…\n 3 https://o… A Mu… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           bronze    https…\n 4 https://o… Neur… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n 5 https://o… COVI… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n 6 https://o… Olfa… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n 7 https://o… Mana… http…             2020 TRUE  FALSE          closed    https…\n 8 https://o… SARS… http…             2021 TRUE  TRUE           green     https…\n 9 https://o… Infe… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n10 https://o… The … http…             2021 TRUE  TRUE           bronze    https…\n# ℹ 11 more variables: any_repository_has_fulltext &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   source_display_name &lt;chr&gt;, source_id &lt;chr&gt;, issn_l &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   host_organization &lt;chr&gt;, host_organization_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   landing_page_url &lt;chr&gt;, pdf_url &lt;chr&gt;, license &lt;chr&gt;, version &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   apc &lt;list&gt;\n\n\nThe first argument within the head function is our data frame df and the second argument is the number of rows we want to have returned.

    "text": "Data wrangling with the tidyverse\nBefore analysing the OpenAlex data, we will have a closer look at the publisher and apc columns and perform some data wrangling tasks.\nTo get an overview of the publishers present in our dataframe and the number of articles per publisher, we will use three tidyverse functions and the pipe operator %&gt;% (magrittr pipe) or |&gt; (base R pipe).\nThe pipe operator allows us to take e.g. a data frame or the result of a function and pass it to another function. If we type the name of our data frame followed by the pipe operator that means we don’t have to specify which data we want a function to be performed on, when we call it after the pipe operator.\nThe group_by function allows us to group data in our data frame df by one or more variables. In this case we will group the data frame by the OpenAlex provided id for the publisher in our host_organization column and the publisher name in our host_organization_name. This allows us to generate aggregate statistics for the publishers in our data frame.\nThe summarise function allows us to calculate summary statistics for each group. In this case we will use the n function to count the number of observations in each group, and the result is stored in a new variable called n.\nThe arrange function is used to sort the data based on the n variable and the desc function lets us determine that the ordering should be in descending order. This means that the groups with the highest number of observations will appear at the top of the output.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(host_organization, host_organization_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# A tibble: 443 × 3\n# Groups:   host_organization [443]\n   host_organization                host_organization_name                     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;int&gt;\n 1 https://openalex.org/P4310320990 Elsevier BV                             2506\n 2 https://openalex.org/P4310320595 Wiley                                   2121\n 3 https://openalex.org/P4310319900 Springer Science+Business Media         1395\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;                             &lt;NA&gt;                                    1127\n 5 https://openalex.org/P4310310987 Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing …  1073\n 6 https://openalex.org/P4310319908 Nature Portfolio                         650\n 7 https://openalex.org/P4310320527 Frontiers Media                          506\n 8 https://openalex.org/P4310311648 Oxford University Press                  481\n 9 https://openalex.org/P4310319965 Springer Nature                          417\n10 https://openalex.org/P4310320006 American Chemical Society                388\n# ℹ 433 more rows\n\n\nThe output shows us some important things about the data:\n\nThere is a significant amount of articles that don’t have any publisher assigned. We can’t cover data cleaning tasks in-depth in this notebook but want to point out that this is something worth investigating further. Questions that could be asked are: Do these articles have a DOI? Were these articles misclassified in any way? Can the publisher information got lost for some reason? Are there any other inconsistencies with these articles? Can I disregard some or all of the articles?\nPublisher names are at least in some cases not standardized or aggregated to a single publishing house. The approach taken to represent the publishing structure, i.e. listing imprints or subsidiaries separately or under the main publisher name, and the point in time of the analysis, have an influence of the results, e.g. because of changes in ownership (see also Scheidt 2025).\n\nAs an example we will look at the publisher names in our data frame that contain Springer or Nature. We will use the filter function from the tidyverse that lets us filter articles that fulfil the condition we specify in combination with the grepl function that allows to search for patterns. In this case we will use a regular expression as the pattern to search for.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(host_organization, host_organization_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%\n  filter(grepl(\"^Springer|Nature\", host_organization_name))\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   host_organization [8]\n  host_organization                host_organization_name                n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;chr&gt;                             &lt;int&gt;\n1 https://openalex.org/P4310319900 Springer Science+Business Media    1395\n2 https://openalex.org/P4310319908 Nature Portfolio                    650\n3 https://openalex.org/P4310319965 Springer Nature                     417\n4 https://openalex.org/P4310319986 Springer VS                          28\n5 https://openalex.org/P4310320108 Springer Nature (Netherlands)         9\n6 https://openalex.org/P4310319972 Springer International Publishing     3\n7 https://openalex.org/P4310321666 Springer Vienna                       2\n8 https://openalex.org/P4310320090 Springer Medizin                      1\n\n\nIf we want to replace the Springer name variants with Springer Nature as publisher name, we can use the mutate function that lets us transform a column in our data frame in combination with the str_replace_all function that lets us replace string values that follow a pattern we specify to do so.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  mutate(host_organization_name = str_replace_all(host_organization_name, \"^Springer.*$|Nature.*$\", \"Springer Nature\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(host_organization_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# A tibble: 434 × 2\n   host_organization_name                             n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Elsevier BV                                     2506\n 2 Springer Nature                                 2505\n 3 Wiley                                           2121\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;                                            1127\n 5 Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute  1073\n 6 Frontiers Media                                  506\n 7 Oxford University Press                          481\n 8 American Chemical Society                        388\n 9 American Physical Society                        350\n10 Taylor & Francis                                 326\n# ℹ 424 more rows\n\n\nBe aware that this data transformation only applies to the publisher name column and not the OpenAlex provided publisher id column.

We will then compute the number of articles in each group. In the ggplot function, we assign the publication year column to the x axis and the number of articles to the y axis. We choose point (geom_point) and line (geom_line) graph types to mark the distinct values of n and have them connected by lines. Both are provided with a colour aesthetic which is set to our open access status column. This will result in different colours being assigned to the points and lines for the different open access status values. With the theme_minimal option we are applying a minimal theme for the plot appearance.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(publication_year, oa_status) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(), .groups = \"keep\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = publication_year, y = n)) +\n  geom_line(aes(colour = oa_status)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = oa_status)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can further choose to visualise the open access distribution over time in terms of percentages. For this we first calculate the share of each open access status per publication year and create a new column using the mutate function that stores these values. We pipe the result through to the ggplot function assigning the publication year column to the x axis and the share to the y axis. We assign the oa_status column to the fill argument which will plot a different colour for each open access status. For this plot we choose a bar chart (geom_bar) graph type and again apply the minimal theme.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(publication_year, oa_status) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(perc = count / sum(count) * 100) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = publication_year, y = perc, fill = oa_status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_minimal()"

This practice includes the handling of data in scientific institutions in general (WP 1), the analysis and evaluation of data in the context of publishing contracts (WP 2), the handling of data on OA in institutional rankings (WP 3) and the collection of data on OA for reporting (WP 4). In line with the aim of ensuring data sovereignty in science, a synopsis will be created in WP 5 based on the findings of WPs 1, 2, 3 and 4. Recommendations (T5.2) are formulated on the basis of this synopsis (T5.1). The aim is to summarise the findings of the previous WPs and to work out their strategic dimension. As a result, summarised recommendations are published (T5.3), which are aimed at decision-makers in universities, non-university research institutions, funding organisations and science policy. Of particular importance here is the integrative view, which summarises the work in the project and highlights the interactions between the WPs. Current science policy recommendations (e.g. from the Alliance, EU, UNESCO, WR, Science Europe) are also placed in relation to the results of the previous WPs. This WP thus acts as an impulse for the future organisation of the OA transformation."

The project initiates the networks and organises them with three digital workshops each over the course of the project. In addition, a mailing list will be organised for the networks, thus providing an impetus for longer-term cooperation.

    "text": "OpenAPC is an initiative that aims to collect information on payments for open access publications (Pieper and Broschinski 2018). The project is located at Bielefeld University Library and started ingesting data from research organizations in 2014. Although the project initially started with a focus on Germany, institutions from more than 20 countries share payment information via OpenAPC as of 2025.\nIf research organizations are pursuing a complete transition away from the subscription model and toward open access, it is important to understand the financial dimension. However, data on open access costs are difficult to obtain. Prices listed on publisher websites can be useful to understand what publishers charge for open access publications. There are lists that collect this information and enable comprehensive analyses across multiple publishers (Butler et al. 2024). In contrast to these price lists, OpenAPC collects information about payments research organizations made. The amounts paid can differ from prices listed on publisher websites, for example if the organization has signed an agreement with the publisher, or if a publisher grants a discount.\nThe OpenAPC dataset shows how much money was spent to publish open access. The initiators imagine that the dataset “[can] be reused to make cash flows between research institutions and publishers more transparent.” (OpenAPC n.d.)\nParticipating in OpenAPC is voluntary. Not all institutions collect data about these payments or pass the data on to OpenAPC."

    "text": "Analyzing and visualizing open access payments\nIn the following sections, we will analyze the data to address our questions and generate visualizations.\n\nHow much did the institution spend on open access publications in total?\nTo determine total open access spending of the research organization, we are using the sum function and apply it to the colum euro. The OpenAPC schema states that this column contains “[t]he APC amount that was paid in EURO. Includes VAT and any discounts”.\n\nsum(df$euro)\n\n[1] 8669107\n\n\nWithout context, this number does not say much. Applying the min and max functions to the column period (“Year of APC payment (YYYY)”), we can see that this sum was accrued over a period of 6 years, from 2018 to 2023.\n\nmin(df$period)\n\n[1] 2018\n\nmax(df$period)\n\n[1] 2023\n\n\nBecause it takes research organizations time to collect and process data on APC payments and submit it to OpenAPC, there is usually a delay in reporting. In this example, data for 2024 is not yet available.\n\n\nHow are payments distributed across journals?\nThe R package dplyr provides a lot of functionality for data wrangling. We can’t go into much detail here, but we will demonstrate how to use some of the most useful functions.\nOne of them is the group_by function. Here, we use it to group the dataset by the column journal_full_title. This will allow us to generate aggregate statistics for articles published within a journal. We then use the pipe operator %&gt;%, which takes output from one function as input for the next function. The input is passed to the summarise function, where we calculate aggregate statistics. For each journal in the dataset, we calculate the total number of articles published (n_articles), the total of APCs paid (sum_apc), the average APC paid per article (avg_apc), and the standard deviation (sd_apc). The last two statistics are rounded to two decimal places. To get a better overview of the data, we then use arrange to sort the result by the total number of articles.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(journal_full_title) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    n_articles = n(),\n    sum_apc = sum(euro),\n    avg_apc = round(sum_apc / n_articles, 2),\n    sd_apc = round(sd(euro), 2)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n_articles))\n\n# A tibble: 923 × 5\n   journal_full_title                          n_articles sum_apc avg_apc sd_apc\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                            &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Scientific Reports                                 232 433492.   1868.   141.\n 2 PLOS ONE                                           134 223456.   1668.   210.\n 3 Frontiers in Immunology                            130 276129.   2124.   516.\n 4 International Journal of Molecular Sciences        124 222282.   1793.   331.\n 5 Journal of Clinical Medicine                       120 212463.   1771.   502.\n 6 Frontiers in Neurology                              70 144595.   2066.   558.\n 7 Cancers                                             66 118423.   1794.   557.\n 8 Allergy                                             61 168277.   2759.   623.\n 9 Frontiers in Psychiatry                             60 128626.   2144.   638.\n10 Frontiers in Physiology                             43  91332    2124    474.\n# ℹ 913 more rows\n\n\nThe results show that Charité paid APCs for 923 journals, as indicated by the number of rows. Most APC payments were made to the journals Scientific Reports, PLOS ONE, and Frontiers in Immunology. The column sd_apc tells us that for some journals, there is a considerable variance in APC payments.\nWe can explore this variance further by visualizing the distribution of APC payments. For this, we will use the packages dplyr and ggplot2. First, we filter the data to focus on the three journals with the most APC payments. We then pass this output to the ggplot function. We assign the column euro to the x axis and the column journal_full_title to the y axis. Next, we define the type of plot we want - here, we choose a box plot to visualize a distribution. Finally, we choose the theme theme_minimal for a simple layout.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(journal_full_title %in% c(\"Scientific Reports\", \"PLOS ONE\", \"Frontiers in Immunology\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = euro, y = journal_full_title)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese box plots show clear differences in the distribution of APC payments. The three journals differ in the median amount of APCs paid - the median is the middle point in a distribution and is visualized by the vertical line in the box plot. We also see that the range of APC payments is highest for Frontiers in Immunology: there are outliers at the bottom and top end of the distribution, as indicated by the dots.\n\n\nHow do payments evolve over the years?\nWe can combine dplyr and ggplot2 to visualize the development of APC payments over time. We will also consider open access types (gold / hybrid).\nFirst, we group the data by period (“Year of APC payment (YYYY)”) and is_hybrid (“Determines if the article has been published in a hybrid journal (TRUE) or in fully/Gold OA journal (FALSE)”). Just like above, we will generate the aggregate statistic n_articles. In the ggplot function, we assign the column period to the x axis, n_articles to the y axis, and is_hybrid to fill - this means that different colours will be assigned to the open access types. We choose the graph type geom_col, a simple bar chart.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(period, is_hybrid) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n_articles = n()) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = n_articles, fill = is_hybrid)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot tells us that the number of APC payments has increased between 2018 and 2021 and has dropped off since. We can also see that APC payments for publications in hybrid open access journals have increased considerably between 2019 and 2020. This is likely the result of transformative agreements between German research organizations and publishers."

    "text": "Description\nBoth the Open Access strategy of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the European Commission’s recommendations on OA to the EU member states call on scientific institutions to increase the transparency of contractual agreements with publishers. The Alliance of German Science Organisations also addresses this issue. In practice, however, with a few exceptions (e.g. the disclosure of DEAL contracts), this demand has not been implemented. While the OpenAPC initiative has created an internationally recognised approach to the disclosure of funds in the area of publication fees, there is still no such initiative for subscription costs, for example. Against this background, the DFG project Transform2Open is endeavouring to create a national transparency initiative that addresses subscription, transformation and OA contracts. Of particular interest are the handling of non-disclosure agreements and current obstacles to transparency endeavours. Practical procedures for disclosing costs are also an important topic. Efforts to open up research information, e.g. as part of the ‘Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information’ initiative, are also creating new opportunities to pool data on publications and their costs. Under the conference motto ‘Shared infrastructures for open science’ of the 25th annual conference of the German Initiative for Networked Information (DINI) on 19 September 2024 in Potsdam, a World Café workshop was held to discuss which aspects and institutions should initially be focused on for a prototype implementation of a transparency initiative. Implementation challenges were jointly identified in order to prepare for practical implementation. The workshop was jointly organised by the DFG projects Transform2Open and OA Datenpraxis. OA Datenpraxis supports the development of structures for the open access transformation at national level. Close cooperation with stakeholders from the DEAL project, OpenAPC, openCost and the OA Monitor exists or will be further expanded."

    "text": "Description\nAgainst the background of the definition of explicit targets for the volume of open access publications by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, some federal states and various other stakeholders, open access reporting is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, circumstances such as the complex data situation make it difficult to implement procedures across the board, and it is becoming clear that the recording of publication volumes should be supplemented by the consideration of further indicators in order to do better justice to the different types of universities and their disciplinary orientation.\nThis interactive workshop is therefore aimed at staff at scientific institutions who are interested in carrying out open access reporting. The workshop will examine and discuss different approaches to open access reporting and provide practical examples of the concrete reporting procedure. The workshop will open with short practical reports on open access reporting at state level based on qualitative and quantitative approaches by the Open Access Office Berlin and the Brandenburg Networking and Competence Centre. Participants will then be given an insight into the use of the Open Access Monitor 1 for reporting the publication volume of their institution and supplementary information on strategies and services of scientific institutions based on the oa.atlas 2 using their own questions and analysis scenarios. Using prepared impulses, participants discuss the opportunities and challenges of the reporting approaches presented in small groups before the results are briefly presented in plenary. After completing the workshop, participants will be familiar with various approaches to open access reporting and will be able to use the Open Access Monitor and the oa.atlas to prepare a report on their open access activities and the publication output of their institution.\nA maximum of 20 people (excluding the organisers) can take part in the workshop. Participants must bring their own laptop."

    "text": "Description\nData on publications and costs are required for the strategic and operational design of the open access transformation. The presentation presents the results of a survey conducted as part of the OA Datenpraxis project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in 2024. The survey investigated how data on publication costs are currently recorded at scientific institutions in Germany. Representatives of universities, universities of applied sciences, institutes of non-university research organisations (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Helmholtz Association, Leibniz Association and Max Planck Society) and federal departmental research institutions were addressed. Of the 583 people invited, 258 (44.3 %) completed the questionnaire. The survey is the first comprehensive survey to record publication costs in Germany.\nThe results show that the majority of respondents at least partially record publication costs. However, the processes are not regulated in a binding manner everywhere. 33.1% of respondents stated that publication costs are recorded decentrally in several departments in several systems at their institution. On average, 2.4 areas of an institution are involved in the processes. 66.3% of respondents rated the cooperation between the institutions involved as ‘very good’ or ‘fairly good’. The reliability of the recording process varies depending on the source of funds, with the use of funds managed by a central service organisation being rated as the most reliable. 80.2% rated the contribution of recording publication costs to shaping the open access transformation as ‘very important’ or ‘fairly important’. However, the data collected is not the basis for strategic decisions at all institutions. The implementation of an information budget by 2025 is considered unlikely at most institutions."

    "text": "Description\nThe Georg-August-Universität Göttingen signed the Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information on 28 August 2024. In doing so, the University of Göttingen is joining renowned international scientific actors who are committed to opening up research information.\nThe presentation will first briefly present the fields of action of the Göttingen State and University Library in line with the principles of the Barcelona Declaration. The presentation will then focus on the evaluation of the applicability of open metadata of scientific publications for the monitoring of international Open Access transformative agreements in comparison to proprietary bibliometric databases. The data analysis of more than 13,000 hybrid scientific journals, which are part of a transformative agreements, from the open sources Crossref and OpenAlex as well as the closed databases Web of Science and Scopus shows potentials and gaps. Building on this, fields of action for the expansion of open metadata are identified, which libraries and publishers can address in the context of negotiations on open access transformative agreements. Overall, open access transformative agreements play a key role in improving open access monitoring through the provision of open metadata by publishers and thus promoting the shift towards open research information in line with the Barcelona Declaration."

    "text": "Description\nThe term “open access monitoring” refers to the collection and analysis of information, publications, costs, and other parameters related to open access publishing. With regards to the objectives and economic dimension of the open access transformation, the handling of this information is becoming increasingly relevant.\nThis workshop is organized by the DFG-funded projects OA Datenpraxis 1, openCost 2, and Transform2Open 3 and is aimed at professionals involved in monitoring.\nThe aim of the workshop is to discuss current issues relating to open access monitoring with participants. The workshop will focus on the following areas: (1) strengthening standardization in the field of monitoring, (2) promoting transparency initiatives, (3)developing the potential for reusing open data – also in the context of the Barcelona Declaration.\nThe workshop begins with a brief introduction of the projects. Participants then discuss issues related to the above-mentioned aspects in groups at different stations in the room, following the World Café format. The results are then summarised in the plenary. Etherpads will be used to collaboratively record results. Following the event, the organizers will communicate the results in a blog post.\nA maximum of 30 people can participate in the workshop. Participants are advised to bring their own laptop."

    "text": "Description\nThe aim of the hands-on lab is to provide a low-threshold practical introduction to the creation of a simple dashboard for visualising the (open access) publication output of academic institutions. For this purpose, Quarto, a scientific and technical open-source publication system, will be used, which makes it possible to create reproducible articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs or books in various (export) formats. The aim is the clear and easily retrievable presentation of different OA-related data and a contribution to a reproducible OA data practice, which is also being strived for and expanded as part of the OA Datenpraxis1 project. At the beginning, a dataset for the own institution is retrieved from OpenAlex2. The basics of using Quarto to load and edit data, create visualisations and present the results in a user-friendly dashboard with R will then be developed together. Previous knowledge of the R programming language or how to use Quarto is not required, but is helpful. The code used in the lab will be developed in such a way that it can be used and understood without prior knowledge. Please bring a laptop and create a Posit Cloud account3 in advance."

    "text": "Description\nThe Carpentries (consisting of Data, Library and Software Carpentry) are a method of introducing basic data competences. The main focus is on the joint learning of IT-supported procedures for solving practical problems. In Germany, both library associations and academic institutions support the Carpentries community through membership. For example, the SUB Göttingen has been a member since 2019 and trains up to five instructors annually at the Göttingen campus and regularly organises Carpentries workshops, which are primarily aimed at young researchers and librarians. The aim of the AP is to design, test and iteratively develop training courses with a specific focus on data practice to shape the OA transformation as part of Library Carpentry. The target group includes professionals in the field of OA transformation and research administration. Not all data analysis aspects can be covered within a Carpentry training course. Rather, the aim is to introduce open and science-oriented tools and procedures and to test their application (Wilson et al., 2017). The tasks of the WP are based on the life cycle of the Carpentries Lessons and start in the second year of the project."

    "text": "Description\nOA transformation agreements are heterogeneous in terms of open metadata despite standardisation initiatives such as ESAC (Borrego et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2022; Marques et al., 2019). At the same time, publishers offer varying degrees of metadata and research services in addition to the OA provision of articles and centralised accounting. The aim of the WP is to analyse publisher agreements relating to open metadata and data-analytical research services and to identify best practices. This is intended to promote competition between publishers."

    "text": "Description\nThe digital strategy of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) states: “By 2025, 70 per cent of all new scientific publications in Germany will be published exclusively or additionally via open access.” (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, 2019, p. 37). In addition to this national OA target, individual federal states have defined specific OA targets. In the “2019 Monitoring Report” of the Joint Science Conference’s (GWK) Pact for Research and Innovation (PFI), the federal and state governments emphasise the need to establish “consistent and comparable surveys on open access publications” (Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz, 2019, p. 16). In a discussion paper published in 2022 by the Working Group on the Scientific Publication System in the Alliance’s priority initiative “Digital Information”, an initial proposal for a common set of indicators on OA for Germany is formulated (Deinzer et al., 2022). The problem with this proposal is that it has not yet been discussed beyond the working group.\nWP 4 builds on this work - in which an applicant was involved as head of the responsible task group of the Scientific Publication System WG - and organises a dialogue to further develop this proposal on the basis of the discussion paper. The aim is to develop a national standard for the definition of OA for reporting and the associated data collection practice."

    "text": "Description\nThe basis for the overall project is an inventory that identifies and documents the topic, the actors and the interplay of aspects of data analyses for shaping the OA transformation. For this purpose, a target group-specific view of professionals who deal with the OA transformation in operational and strategic areas of scientific institutions on the basis of publication and cost data is taken. The focus is on administrative and library staff at universities and non-university institutions. These include professionals in the areas of digital publishing, OA, acquisition and collection development, research information and research funding.\nBased on a stakeholder analysis (T1.1), the need for information, the handling of data sources and the interdependence of data analyses in the context of OA transformation at academic institutions will be surveyed (T1.2). The potential of the open science monitoring systems currently being developed will also be analysed. The resulting inventory (T1.3), which looks at the specific practices in dealing with data on OA and future requirements of those involved, will create the basis for recommendations on the topic (WP 5)."
