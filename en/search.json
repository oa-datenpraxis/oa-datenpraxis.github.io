In addition to this national OA target, individual federal states have defined specific OA targets. In the “2019 Monitoring Report” of the Joint Science Conference’s (GWK) Pact for Research and Innovation (PFI), the federal and state governments emphasise the need to establish “consistent and comparable surveys on open access publications” (Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz, 2019, p. 16). In a discussion paper published in 2022 by the Working Group on the Scientific Publication System in the Alliance’s priority initiative “Digital Information”, an initial proposal for a common set of indicators on OA for Germany is formulated (Deinzer et al., 2022). The problem with this proposal is that it has not yet been discussed beyond the working group.\nWP 4 builds on this work - in which an applicant was involved as head of the responsible task group of the Scientific Publication System WG - and organises a dialogue to further develop this proposal on the basis of the discussion paper. The aim is to develop a national standard for the definition of OA for reporting and the associated data collection practice."

For example, the SUB Göttingen has been a member since 2019 and trains up to five instructors annually at the Göttingen campus and regularly organises Carpentries workshops, which are primarily aimed at young researchers and librarians. The aim of the AP is to design, test and iteratively develop training courses with a specific focus on data practice to shape the OA transformation as part of Library Carpentry. The target group includes professionals in the field of OA transformation and research administration. Not all data analysis aspects can be covered within a Carpentry training course. Rather, the aim is to introduce open and science-oriented tools and procedures and to test their application (Wilson et al., 2017). The tasks of the WP are based on the life cycle of the Carpentries Lessons and start in the second year of the project."

The project initiates the networks and organises them with three digital workshops each over the course of the project. In addition, a mailing list will be organised for the networks, thus providing an impetus for longer-term cooperation. At the end of the project, it will be determined with other stakeholders, such as the Conference of Information and Library Science Training and Study Programmes (KIBA), to what extent the topics discussed can be continued in other committees and networks."

The presentation will then focus on the evaluation of the applicability of open metadata of scientific publications for the monitoring of international Open Access transformative agreements in comparison to proprietary bibliometric databases. The data analysis of more than 13,000 hybrid scientific journals, which are part of a transformative agreements, from the open sources Crossref and OpenAlex as well as the closed databases Web of Science and Scopus shows potentials and gaps. Building on this, fields of action for the expansion of open metadata are identified, which libraries and publishers can address in the context of negotiations on open access transformative agreements. Overall, open access transformative agreements play a key role in improving open access monitoring through the provision of open metadata by publishers and thus promoting the shift towards open research information in line with the Barcelona Declaration."

The aim is the clear and easily retrievable presentation of different OA-related data and a contribution to a reproducible OA data practice, which is also being strived for and expanded as part of the OA Datenpraxis1 project. At the beginning, a dataset for the own institution is retrieved from OpenAlex2. The basics of using Quarto to load and edit data, create visualisations and present the results in a user-friendly dashboard with R will then be developed together. Previous knowledge of the R programming language or how to use Quarto is not required, but is helpful. The code used in the lab will be developed in such a way that it can be used and understood without prior knowledge. Please bring a laptop and create a Posit Cloud account3 in advance."

    "text": "Description\nAgainst the background of the definition of explicit targets for the volume of open access publications by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, some federal states and various other stakeholders, open access reporting is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, circumstances such as the complex data situation make it difficult to implement procedures across the board, and it is becoming clear that the recording of publication volumes should be supplemented by the consideration of further indicators in order to do better justice to the different types of universities and their disciplinary orientation.\nThis interactive workshop is therefore aimed at staff at scientific institutions who are interested in carrying out open access reporting. The workshop will examine and discuss different approaches to open access reporting and provide practical examples of the concrete reporting procedure. The workshop will open with short practical reports on open access reporting at state level based on qualitative and quantitative approaches by the Open Access Office Berlin and the Brandenburg Networking and Competence Centre. Participants will then be given an insight into the use of the Open Access Monitor 1 for reporting the publication volume of their institution and supplementary information on strategies and services of scientific institutions based on the oa.atlas 2 using their own questions and analysis scenarios. Using prepared impulses, participants discuss the opportunities and challenges of the reporting approaches presented in small groups before the results are briefly presented in plenary. After completing the workshop, participants will be familiar with various approaches to open access reporting and will be able to use the Open Access Monitor and the oa.atlas to prepare a report on their open access activities and the publication output of their institution.\nA maximum of 20 people (excluding the organisers) can take part in the workshop. Participants must bring their own laptop."

    "text": "Description\nOpen metadata on scientific publications increasingly play an important role in university rankings. They not only enable comprehensive and transparent reporting on the research performance of universities, but also offer a wide range of reuse options.\nThe webinar will present the Leiden Ranking of the CWTS, which now also utilises open metadata. The example of the University of Konstanz will then be used to illustrate how universities can use the ranking to provide data-supported information about the research and open access achievements of their institution both internally and externally.\nWe are delighted that Dr Nees Jan van Eck (CWTS Leiden) and Dr Anja Oberländer (University of Konstanz) will be sharing their insights with us, both from the perspective of creating a ranking and from the application perspective.\nThis webinar is aimed at all employees in the field of Open Access/Open Science and heads of scientific institutions, as well as people interested in science assessment and Open Access/Open Science.\n\nProgramme:\n\nWelcome by Sophia Dörner (5 minutes)\nPresentation 1: Nees Jan van Eck (CWTS Leiden) introduces the Leiden Ranking Open Edition with a focus on open data and open access as a ranking dimension (20 minutes).\nPresentation 2: Anja Oberländer (University of Konstanz) provides a user perspective on the Leiden Ranking and discusses strategic approaches to Open Access/Open Science (20 minutes).\nQ&A Session (15 minutes)."

    "text": "Description\nData on publications and costs are required for the strategic and operational design of the open access transformation. The presentation presents the results of a survey conducted as part of the OA Datenpraxis project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in 2024. The survey investigated how data on publication costs are currently recorded at scientific institutions in Germany. Representatives of universities, universities of applied sciences, institutes of non-university research organisations (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Helmholtz Association, Leibniz Association and Max Planck Society) and federal departmental research institutions were addressed. Of the 583 people invited, 258 (44.3 %) completed the questionnaire. The survey is the first comprehensive survey to record publication costs in Germany.\nThe results show that the majority of respondents at least partially record publication costs. However, the processes are not regulated in a binding manner everywhere. 33.1% of respondents stated that publication costs are recorded decentrally in several departments in several systems at their institution. On average, 2.4 areas of an institution are involved in the processes. 66.3% of respondents rated the cooperation between the institutions involved as ‘very good’ or ‘fairly good’. The reliability of the recording process varies depending on the source of funds, with the use of funds managed by a central service organisation being rated as the most reliable. 80.2% rated the contribution of recording publication costs to shaping the open access transformation as ‘very important’ or ‘fairly important’. However, the data collected is not the basis for strategic decisions at all institutions. The implementation of an information budget by 2025 is considered unlikely at most institutions."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nBoth the Open Access strategy of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the European Commission’s recommendations on OA to the EU member states call on scientific institutions to increase the transparency of contractual agreements with publishers. The Alliance of German Science Organisations also addresses this issue. In practice, however, with a few exceptions (e.g. the disclosure of DEAL contracts), this demand has not been implemented. While the OpenAPC initiative has created an internationally recognised approach to the disclosure of funds in the area of publication fees, there is still no such initiative for subscription costs, for example. Against this background, the DFG project Transform2Open is endeavouring to create a national transparency initiative that addresses subscription, transformation and OA contracts. Of particular interest are the handling of non-disclosure agreements and current obstacles to transparency endeavours. Practical procedures for disclosing costs are also an important topic. Efforts to open up research information, e.g. as part of the ‘Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information’ initiative, are also creating new opportunities to pool data on publications and their costs. Under the conference motto ‘Shared infrastructures for open science’ of the 25th annual conference of the German Initiative for Networked Information (DINI) on 19 September 2024 in Potsdam, a World Café workshop was held to discuss which aspects and institutions should initially be focused on for a prototype implementation of a transparency initiative. Implementation challenges were jointly identified in order to prepare for practical implementation. The workshop was jointly organised by the DFG projects Transform2Open and OA Datenpraxis. OA Datenpraxis supports the development of structures for the open access transformation at national level. Close cooperation with stakeholders from the DEAL project, OpenAPC, openCost and the OA Monitor exists or will be further expanded."

    "text": "Description\nInstitutional rankings enjoy a high level of attention among science policy decision-makers and the public because they succeed in comparing scientific institutions with each other in a generally understandable and clear manner. Despite numerous points of criticism, rankings can therefore not be ignored as a measure of the perception of academic institutions and play a corresponding role in institutional information management.\nWP 3 takes into account that OA is increasingly appearing as a comparative dimension in rankings, for example in the Leiden Ranking of the CWTS, the COKI Open Access Dashboard and the Scimago Institutions Ranking."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nA common understanding of science-led data practice is a prerequisite for shaping the OA transformation. This practice includes the handling of data in scientific institutions in general (WP 1), the analysis and evaluation of data in the context of publishing contracts (WP 2), the handling of data on OA in institutional rankings (WP 3) and the collection of data on OA for reporting (WP 4). In line with the aim of ensuring data sovereignty in science, a synopsis will be created in WP 5 based on the findings of WPs 1, 2, 3 and 4. Recommendations (T5.2) are formulated on the basis of this synopsis (T5.1). The aim is to summarise the findings of the previous WPs and to work out their strategic dimension. As a result, summarised recommendations are published (T5.3), which are aimed at decision-makers in universities, non-university research institutions, funding organisations and science policy. Of particular importance here is the integrative view, which summarises the work in the project and highlights the interactions between the WPs. Current science policy recommendations (e.g. from the Alliance, EU, UNESCO, WR, Science Europe) are also placed in relation to the results of the previous WPs. This WP thus acts as an impulse for the future organisation of the OA transformation."

At the same time, publishers offer varying degrees of metadata and research services in addition to the OA provision of articles and centralised accounting. The aim of the WP is to analyse publisher agreements relating to open metadata and data-analytical research services and to identify best practices. This is intended to promote competition between publishers."

For this purpose, a target group-specific view of professionals who deal with the OA transformation in operational and strategic areas of scientific institutions on the basis of publication and cost data is taken. The focus is on administrative and library staff at universities and non-university institutions. These include professionals in the areas of digital publishing, OA, acquisition and collection development, research information and research funding.\nBased on a stakeholder analysis (T1.1), the need for information, the handling of data sources and the interdependence of data analyses in the context of OA transformation at academic institutions will be surveyed (T1.2). The potential of the open science monitoring systems currently being developed will also be analysed. The resulting inventory (T1.3), which looks at the specific practices in dealing with data on OA and future requirements of those involved, will create the basis for recommendations on the topic (WP 5)."
