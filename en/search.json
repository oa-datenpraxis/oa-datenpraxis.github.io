    "text": "Description\nA common understanding of science-led data practice is a prerequisite for shaping the OA transformation. This practice includes the handling of data in scientific institutions in general (WP 1), the analysis and evaluation of data in the context of publishing contracts (WP 2), the handling of data on OA in institutional rankings (WP 3) and the collection of data on OA for reporting (WP 4). In line with the aim of ensuring data sovereignty in science, a synopsis will be created in WP 5 based on the findings of WPs 1, 2, 3 and 4. Recommendations (T5.2) are formulated on the basis of this synopsis (T5.1). The aim is to summarise the findings of the previous WPs and to work out their strategic dimension. As a result, summarised recommendations are published (T5.3), which are aimed at decision-makers in universities, non-university research institutions, funding organisations and science policy. Of particular importance here is the integrative view, which summarises the work in the project and highlights the interactions between the WPs. Current science policy recommendations (e.g. from the Alliance, EU, UNESCO, WR, Science Europe) are also placed in relation to the results of the previous WPs. This WP thus acts as an impulse for the future organisation of the OA transformation."

The aim of the WP is to facilitate dialogue on defined issues beyond professional profiles and thus actively enable inter- and transdisciplinary discourse on data work relating to OA. The project initiates the networks and organises them with three digital workshops each over the course of the project. In addition, a mailing list will be organised for the networks, thus providing an impetus for longer-term cooperation. At the end of the project, it will be determined with other stakeholders, such as the Conference of Information and Library Science Training and Study Programmes (KIBA), to what extent the topics discussed can be continued in other committees and networks."

The main focus is on the joint learning of IT-supported procedures for solving practical problems. In Germany, both library associations and academic institutions support the Carpentries community through membership. For example, the SUB Göttingen has been a member since 2019 and trains up to five instructors annually at the Göttingen campus and regularly organises Carpentries workshops, which are primarily aimed at young researchers and librarians. The aim of the AP is to design, test and iteratively develop training courses with a specific focus on data practice to shape the OA transformation as part of Library Carpentry. The target group includes professionals in the field of OA transformation and research administration. Not all data analysis aspects can be covered within a Carpentry training course. Rather, the aim is to introduce open and science-oriented tools and procedures and to test their application (Wilson et al., 2017). The tasks of the WP are based on the life cycle of the Carpentries Lessons and start in the second year of the project."

For this purpose, a target group-specific view of professionals who deal with the OA transformation in operational and strategic areas of scientific institutions on the basis of publication and cost data is taken. The focus is on administrative and library staff at universities and non-university institutions. These include professionals in the areas of digital publishing, OA, acquisition and collection development, research information and research funding.\nBased on a stakeholder analysis (T1.1), the need for information, the handling of data sources and the interdependence of data analyses in the context of OA transformation at academic institutions will be surveyed (T1.2). The potential of the open science monitoring systems currently being developed will also be analysed. The resulting inventory (T1.3), which looks at the specific practices in dealing with data on OA and future requirements of those involved, will create the basis for recommendations on the topic (WP 5)."

In addition to this national OA target, individual federal states have defined specific OA targets. In the “2019 Monitoring Report” of the Joint Science Conference’s (GWK) Pact for Research and Innovation (PFI), the federal and state governments emphasise the need to establish “consistent and comparable surveys on open access publications” (Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz, 2019, p. 16). In a discussion paper published in 2022 by the Working Group on the Scientific Publication System in the Alliance’s priority initiative “Digital Information”, an initial proposal for a common set of indicators on OA for Germany is formulated (Deinzer et al., 2022). The problem with this proposal is that it has not yet been discussed beyond the working group.\nWP 4 builds on this work - in which an applicant was involved as head of the responsible task group of the Scientific Publication System WG - and organises a dialogue to further develop this proposal on the basis of the discussion paper. The aim is to develop a national standard for the definition of OA for reporting and the associated data collection practice."
