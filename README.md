## About OA Datenpraxis

The project OA Datenpraxis is a joint project by the [Berlin School of Library and Information Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/informationmanagement), the [Helmholtz Open Science Office](https://os.helmholtz.de/en/) and the [Göttingen State and University Library](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en) that supports the development of structures for the open access transformation at research institutions in Germany. The focus is on promoting and establishing processes and procedures for sovereign data practice in shaping the open access transformation.

The project supports practitioners in administration, libraries and other service institutions in professionalizing their data practices by promoting the organization, networking and standardization of processes through a coordinated approach.
