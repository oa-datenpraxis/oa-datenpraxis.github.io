## Description

There is now a wide range of tools for collecting, analysing and visualising data relating to the OA transformation. In addition to the already established services such as the [Hybrid Open Access Dashboard (HOAD)](https://subugoe.github.io/hoaddash/), [OpenAPC](https://openapc.net/) and [Open Access Monitor](https://open-access-monitor.de/), these include, for example

- API clients for computer-aided access to open data sources (e.g. clients from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) for publication analyses with R)
- Paid tools such as Unsub, a tool for libraries to evaluate publishing offers based on local usage data.
- Paid tools such as ChronosHub, Oable, OAMetrix and OA Switchboard for APC management.
- Dashboards for data visualisation such as the COKI Open Access Dashboard, the Charit√© Open Access Dashboard and the Hamburg Open Science Dashboard.

As there is currently no overview of these diverse tools and there are no systematic training and further education and further training procedures in the field of Scholarly Communication Analytics, a digital toolbox is to be developed in WP 5. This will provide information on tools for data work relating to OA
transformation. Based on research, the tools will be described by a metadata schema to be developed.

tools. The resulting toolbox will be presented on the project website. After the end of the
curation will be continued by the Helmholtz Open Science Office. The toolbox will be operated in
English language.
