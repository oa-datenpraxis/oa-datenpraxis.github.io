## Description

The digital strategy of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) states: "By 2025, 70 per cent of all new scientific publications in Germany will be published exclusively or additionally via open access." (Federal Ministry of Education and Research, 2019, p. 37) In addition to this national OA target, individual federal states have defined specific OA targets. In the "2019 Monitoring Report" of the Joint Science Conference's (GWK) Pact for Research and Innovation (PFI), the federal and state governments emphasise the need to establish "consistent and comparable surveys on open access publications" (Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz, 2019, p. 16). In a discussion paper published in 2022 by the Working Group on the Scientific Publication System in the Alliance's priority initiative "Digital Information", an initial proposal for a common set of indicators on OA for Germany is formulated (Deinzer et al., 2022). The problem with this proposal is that it has not yet been discussed beyond the working group.

WP 4 builds on this work - in which an applicant was involved as head of the responsible task group of the Scientific Publication System WG - and organises a dialogue to further develop this proposal on the basis of the discussion paper. The aim is to develop a national standard for the definition of OA for reporting and the associated data collection practice.
