## Description

The Carpentries (consisting of Data, Library and Software Carpentry) are a method of introducing basic data competences. The main focus is on the joint learning of IT-supported procedures for solving practical problems. In Germany, both library associations and academic institutions support the Carpentries community through membership. For example, the SUB Göttingen has been a member since 2019 and trains up to five instructors annually at the Göttingen campus and regularly organises Carpentries workshops, which are primarily aimed at young researchers and librarians. The aim of the AP is to design, test and iteratively develop training courses with a specific focus on data practice to shape the OA transformation as part of Library Carpentry. The target group includes professionals in the field of OA transformation and research administration. Not all data analysis aspects can be covered within a Carpentry training course. Rather, the aim is to introduce open and science-oriented tools and procedures and to test their application (Wilson et al., 2017). The tasks of the WP are based on the life cycle of the Carpentries Lessons9 and start in the second year of the project.
