Furthermore, it shows that most of the column values are of data type character (chr), the publication year column values are of type integer (int), some of the open access column values are of type logical (lgl) and the apc column values are of type list (list). The output also indicates the first values of every column on the right hand side.\nThe first values show us two important things:\n\nThere are at least some missing values within our data frame as is indicated by the NA in the license and version columns. NA is not a common string or numeric value, but a reserved word in R for the logical constant which contains a missing value indicator, i.e. R uses NA to indicate that the specific value is missing.\nThe apc column contains data frames as values. This means we can’t access the apc information directly. We will explore later in the notebook how to transform the column and access the apc information.\n\nTo look at the first 10 rows of our data frame we are using the head function.\n\nhead(df, 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 19\n   id         title doi   publication_year is_oa is_oa_anywhere oa_status oa_url\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 https://o… SARS… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           bronze    https…\n 2 https://o… IDF … http…             2021 FALSE TRUE           green     https…\n 3 https://o… A Mu… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           bronze    https…\n 4 https://o… Neur… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n 5 https://o… COVI… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n 6 https://o… Olfa… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n 7 https://o… Mana… http…             2020 TRUE  FALSE          closed    https…\n 8 https://o… SARS… http…             2021 TRUE  TRUE           green     https…\n 9 https://o… Infe… http…             2020 TRUE  TRUE           hybrid    https…\n10 https://o… The … http…             2021 TRUE  TRUE           bronze    https…\n# ℹ 11 more variables: any_repository_has_fulltext &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   source_display_name &lt;chr&gt;, source_id &lt;chr&gt;, issn_l &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   host_organization &lt;chr&gt;, host_organization_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   landing_page_url &lt;chr&gt;, pdf_url &lt;chr&gt;, license &lt;chr&gt;, version &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   apc &lt;list&gt;\n\n\nThe first argument within the head function is our data frame df and the second argument is the number of rows we want to have returned.

    "text": "Data wrangling with the tidyverse\nBefore analysing the OpenAlex data, we will have a closer look at the publisher and apc columns and perform some data wrangling tasks.\nTo get an overview of the publishers present in our dataframe and the number of articles per publisher, we will use three tidyverse functions and the base R pipe operator |&gt;. The magrittr package, which is part of the tidyverse, provides another pipe operator (%&gt;%), however, we will use the base R pipe since you won’t need to install an additional package to use it.\nThe pipe operator allows us to take e.g. a data frame or the result of a function and pass it to another function. If we type the name of our data frame followed by the pipe operator that means we don’t have to specify which data we want a function to be performed on, when we call it after the pipe operator.\nThe group_by function allows us to group data in our data frame df by one or more variables. In this case we will group the data frame by the OpenAlex provided id for the publisher in our host_organization column and the publisher name in our host_organization_name column. This allows us to generate aggregate statistics for the publishers in our data frame.\nThe summarise function allows us to calculate summary statistics for each group. In this case we will use the n function to count the number of observations in each group, and the result is stored in a new variable called n.\nThe arrange function is used to sort the data based on the n variable and the desc function lets us determine that the ordering should be in descending order. This means that the groups with the highest number of observations will appear at the top of the output.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(host_organization, host_organization_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# A tibble: 443 × 3\n# Groups:   host_organization [443]\n   host_organization                host_organization_name                     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;int&gt;\n 1 https://openalex.org/P4310320990 Elsevier BV                             2506\n 2 https://openalex.org/P4310320595 Wiley                                   2121\n 3 https://openalex.org/P4310319900 Springer Science+Business Media         1395\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;                             &lt;NA&gt;                                    1127\n 5 https://openalex.org/P4310310987 Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing …  1073\n 6 https://openalex.org/P4310319908 Nature Portfolio                         650\n 7 https://openalex.org/P4310320527 Frontiers Media                          506\n 8 https://openalex.org/P4310311648 Oxford University Press                  481\n 9 https://openalex.org/P4310319965 Springer Nature                          417\n10 https://openalex.org/P4310320006 American Chemical Society                388\n# ℹ 433 more rows\n\n\nThe output shows us some important things about the data:\n\nThere is a significant amount of articles that don’t have any publisher assigned. We can’t cover data cleaning tasks in-depth in this notebook but want to point out that this is something worth investigating further. Questions that could be asked are: Do these articles have a DOI? Were these articles misclassified in any way? Did the publisher information get lost for some reason? Are there any other inconsistencies with these articles? Can I disregard some or all of the articles?\nPublisher names are at least in some cases not standardized or aggregated to a single publishing house. The approach taken to represent the publishing structure, i.e. listing imprints or subsidiaries separately or under the main publisher name, and the point in time of the analysis, have an influence of the results, e.g. because of changes in ownership (see also Scheidt, 2025).\n\nAs an example we will look at the publisher names in our data frame that contain Springer or Nature. We will use the filter function from the tidyverse that lets us filter articles that fulfil the condition we specify in combination with the grepl function that allows to search for patterns. In this case we will use a regular expression as the pattern to search for.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(host_organization, host_organization_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"^Springer|Nature\", host_organization_name))\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   host_organization [8]\n  host_organization                host_organization_name                n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;chr&gt;                             &lt;int&gt;\n1 https://openalex.org/P4310319900 Springer Science+Business Media    1395\n2 https://openalex.org/P4310319908 Nature Portfolio                    650\n3 https://openalex.org/P4310319965 Springer Nature                     417\n4 https://openalex.org/P4310319986 Springer VS                          28\n5 https://openalex.org/P4310320108 Springer Nature (Netherlands)         9\n6 https://openalex.org/P4310319972 Springer International Publishing     3\n7 https://openalex.org/P4310321666 Springer Vienna                       2\n8 https://openalex.org/P4310320090 Springer Medizin                      1\n\n\nIf we want to replace the Springer name variants with Springer Nature as publisher name, we can use the mutate function that lets us transform a column in our data frame in combination with the str_replace_all function that lets us replace string values that follow a pattern we specify to do so.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(host_organization_name = str_replace_all(host_organization_name, \"^Springer.*$|Nature.*$\", \"Springer Nature\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(host_organization_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# A tibble: 434 × 2\n   host_organization_name                             n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Elsevier BV                                     2506\n 2 Springer Nature                                 2505\n 3 Wiley                                           2121\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;                                            1127\n 5 Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute  1073\n 6 Frontiers Media                                  506\n 7 Oxford University Press                          481\n 8 American Chemical Society                        388\n 9 American Physical Society                        350\n10 Taylor & Francis                                 326\n# ℹ 424 more rows\n\n\nBe aware that this data transformation only applies to the publisher name column and not the OpenAlex provided publisher id column. We would need to perform a separate transformation step to align both. Additionally, we did not permanently rename the publisher name values in our data frame.

Furthermore Scientific Reports appears to be a true gold open access journal.\nHow does the number of open access publications evolve over time?\nWe can combine functions from the tidyverse and ggplot2 to visualise the development of open access over time.\nFirst, we group the data by publication year and open access status. We will then compute the number of articles in each group. In the ggplot function, we assign the publication year column to the x axis and the number of articles to the y axis. We choose point (geom_point) and line (geom_line) graph types to mark the distinct values of n and have them connected by lines. Both are provided with a colour aesthetic which is set to our open access status column. This will result in different colours being assigned to the points and lines for the different open access status values. With the theme_minimal option we are applying a minimal theme for the plot appearance.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(publication_year, oa_status) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n(), .groups = \"keep\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = publication_year, y = n)) +\n  geom_line(aes(colour = oa_status)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = oa_status)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows use the total number of publications for each publication year and open access status. Generally, there seems to be a downwards trend in terms of publication volume for all open access status types but hybrid open access.\nWe can further choose to visualise the open access distribution over time in terms of percentages. For this we first calculate the share of each open access status per publication year and create a new column using the mutate function that stores these values. We pipe the result through to the ggplot function assigning the publication year column to the x axis and the share to the y axis. We assign the oa_status column to the fill argument which will plot a different colour for each open access status. For this plot we choose a bar chart (geom_bar) graph type and again apply the minimal theme.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(publication_year, oa_status) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(perc = count / sum(count) * 100) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = publication_year, y = perc, fill = oa_status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows use the share of each open access status for each publication year. The most dominant open access types are gold and hybrid open access. Furthermore the share of open access publications across all publication years is higher than for closed access publications."

Entsprechend des Anliegens der Sicherung von Datensouveränität in der Wissenschaft wird auf Basis der Erkenntnisse in den APs 1, 2, 3 und 4 im AP 5 eine Synopse erstellt. Auf Grundlage dieser Synopse (T5.1) werden Empfehlungen formuliert (T5.2). Anliegen ist es, die Erkenntnisse der vorhergehenden APs zusammenzuführen und deren strategische Dimension herauszuarbeiten. Als Ergebnis werden zusammenfassende Empfehlungen veröffentlicht (T5.3), die sich an Entscheider:innen in Universitäten, außeruniversitären Forschungseinrichtungen, Förderorganisationen und der Wissenschaftspolitik wenden. Von besonderer Bedeutung ist hier der integrative Blick, der die Arbeiten im Projekt zusammenfasst und die Interaktionen zwischen den APs herausstellt.

Anliegen des APs ist es, den Dialog zu definierten Fragestellungen über Berufsprofile hinaus zu ermöglichen und damit aktiv den inter- und transdisziplinären Diskurs zur Datenarbeit rund um OA zu ermöglichen. Das Projekt initiiert die Netzwerke und organisiert sie mit je drei digitalen Workshops in der Projektlaufzeit. Darüber hinaus wird eine Mailingliste für die Netzwerke organisiert und somit ein Anstoß zur längerfristigen Kooperation gegeben. Zum Projektende wird mit weiteren Stakeholdern, wie z. B. der Konferenz der informations- und bibliothekswissenschaftlichen Ausbildungs- und Studiengänge (KIBA) eruiert, inwiefern die behandelten Themen in weiteren Gremien und Netzwerken fortgeführt werden können."

    "text": "Beschreibung\nZur Erhebung, Analyse und Visualisierung von Daten rund um die OA-Transformation gibt es mittlerweile ein großes Angebot an Werkzeugen. Neben den bereits etablierten Diensten wie dem Hybrid Open Access Dashboard (HOAD), OpenAPC und Open Access Monitor sind dies z. B.\n\nAPI-Clients für den computergestützten Zugriff auf offene Datenquellen (z. B. Clients von rOpenSci rund um Publikationsanalysen mit R)\nkostenpflichtige Werkzeuge wie z. B. Unsub, ein Tool für Bibliotheken zur Bewertung von Verlagsangeboten anhand lokaler Nutzungsdaten.\nkostenpflichtige Werkzeuge wie ChronosHub, Oable, OAMetrix und OA Switchboard rund um das APC-Management.\nDashboards zur Datenvisualisierung wie das COKI Open Access Dashboard, das Charité Open Access Dashboard oder das Hamburg Open Science Dashboard.\n\nDa es bisher keine Übersicht dieser vielfältigen Werkzeuge gibt und es bisher keine systematischen Aus- und Weiterbildungsverfahren im Bereich Scholarly Communication Analytics gibt, soll in AP 5 eine digitale Toolbox aufgebaut werden. Diese informiert über Werkzeuge der Datenarbeit rund um die OA- Transformation. Ausgehend von einer Recherche werden die Werkzeuge durch ein zu entwickelndes Metadatenschema beschrieben. Dieses Schema soll die Auffindbarkeit und Bewertung der Werkzeuge unterstützen. Die so entstehende Toolbox wird auf der Webseite des Projektes präsentiert. Nach Ende des Vorhabens wird die Kuration durch das Helmholtz Open Science Office fortgeführt. Die Toolbox wird in englischer Sprache betrieben."

    "text": "Beschreibung\nDas Ziel des Hands-on Labs ist, eine niedrigschwellige praktische Einführung in die Erstellung eines einfachen Dashboards zur Darstellung des (Open-Access-)Publikationsoutputs wissenschaftlicher Einrichtungen zu geben. Zu diesem Zweck wird Quarto genutzt, ein wissenschaftliches und technisches Open-Source-Publikationssystem, das es ermöglicht, reproduzierbare Artikel, Präsentationen, Dashboards, Websites, Blogs oder Bücher in verschiedenen (Export-)Formaten zu erstellen. Ziel ist die übersichtliche und leicht abrufbare Darstellung von unterschiedlichen OA-bezogenen Daten und ein Beitrag zu einer reproduzierbaren OA Datenpraxis, welche auch im Rahmen des Projekts OA Datenpraxis1 angestrebt und ausgebaut werden. Es wird zu Beginn ein Datensatz für die eigene Institution von OpenAlex2 abgefragt. Anschließend werden gemeinsam die Grundlagen der Verwendung von Quarto zum Laden und Bearbeiten von Daten, zur Erstellung von Visualisierungen und zur Präsentation der Ergebnisse in einem benutzerfreundlichen Dashboard mit R erarbeitet. Vorkenntnisse in der Programmiersprache R oder im Umgang mit Quarto werden nicht vorausgesetzt, sind jedoch hilfreich. Der im Rahmen des Labs verwendete Code wird so erarbeitet, dass er auch ohne Vorkenntnisse genutzt und nachvollzogen werden kann.

    "text": "Beschreibung\nUnter dem Begriff Open-Access-Monitoring wird die Erfassung und Analyse von Informationen, Publikationen, Kosten und weiteren Parametern des Open-Access-Publizierens verstanden. Mit Blick auf Zielmarken sowie auf die ökonomische Dimension der Open-Access-Transformation gewinnt der Umgang mit diesen Informationen weiter an Relevanz.\nDieser Workshop wird gemeinsam von den DFG-geförderten Projekten OA Datenpraxis 1, openCost 2 und Transform2Open 3 veranstaltet und richtet sich an Professionals, die sich mit Monitoring beschäftigen.\nZiel des Workshops ist es, gemeinsam mit den Teilnehmenden aktuelle Fragestellungen des Open-Access-Monitorings zu diskutieren. Dabei widmet sich der Workshop den folgenden Handlungsfeldern: (1) die Stärkung der Standardisierung im Bereich des Monitorings, (2) die Förderung von Transparenzinitiativen in diesem Bereich, (3) die Weiterentwicklung der Nachnutzungsmöglichkeiten offener Daten – auch im Kontext der Barcelona Declaration.\nDer Workshop beginnt mit einer kurzen Vorstellung der beteiligten Projekte. Anschließend bearbeiten Teilnehmende vorbereitete Impulse im Format World Café. Hierbei diskutieren die Teilnehmenden in Gruppen Fragestellungen zu den oben genannten Aspekten an verschiedenen Stationen im Raum. Anschließend werden die Ergebnisse im Plenum zusammengetragen. Als kollaboratives Tool für die Diskussion und Ergebnissicherung wird ein Etherpad verwendet. Die Ergebnisse werden im Anschluss an die Veranstaltung durch die Organisator:innen in einem Blogpost aufbereitet und kommuniziert.\nAn dem Workshop können maximal 30 Personen teilnehmen. Teilnehmenden wird empfohlen, einen eigenen Laptop mitzubringen."

    "text": "Beschreibung\nDie Georg-August-Universität Göttingen hat am 28. August 2024 die „Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information“ unterzeichnet. Damit schließt sich die Universität Göttingen namhaften internationalen Wissenschaftsakteuren an, die sich für die Öffnung von Forschungsinformationen einsetzen.\nDer Vortrag stellt zunächst die diesbezüglichen Handlungsfelder der Niedersächsischen Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen im Sinne der Prinzipien der Barcelona Declaration kurz vor. Der Schwerpunkt des Vortrags liegt dann auf der Bewertung der Anwendbarkeit offener Metadaten wissenschaftlicher Publikationen für das Monitoring internationaler Open-Access-Transformationsverträge im Vergleich zu proprietären Bibliometriedatenbanken. Die Datenanalyse von mehr als 13.000 hybriden wissenschaftlichen Zeitschriften, die Teil eines Transformationsvertrages sind, aus den offenen Quellen Crossref und OpenAlex sowie den geschlossenen Datenbanken Web of Science und Scopus zeigt Potenziale und Lücken auf. Darauf aufbauend werden Handlungsfelder für den Ausbau offener Metadaten benannt, die Bibliotheken und Verlage im Rahmen von Verhandlungen über Open-Access-Transformationsverträge adressieren können. Insgesamt kommt Open-Access-Transformationsverträgen eine Schlüsselrolle zu, um durch die Bereitstellung offener Metadaten seitens der Verlage das Open-Access-Monitoring zu verbessern und damit den Wandel hin zu offenen Forschungsinformationen im Sinne der Barcelona Declaration zu fördern."

    "text": "Beschreibung\nZur strategischen und operativen Gestaltung der Open-Access-Transformation werden Daten zu Publikationen und Kosten benötigt. Der Vortrag stellt Ergebnisse einer Umfrage vor, die im Rahmen des von der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) geförderten Projekts OA Datenpraxis im Jahr 2024 durchgeführt wurde. Die Umfrage erhob, wie Daten zu Publikationskosten aktuell an wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen in Deutschland erfasst werden. Adressiert wurden Vertreter*innen von Universitäten, Fachhochschulen, Instituten außeruniversitärer Forschungseinrichtungen (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, Leibniz-Gesellschaft und Max-Planck-Gesellschaft) sowie Ressortforschungseinrichtungen des Bundes. Von den 583 eingeladenen Personen füllten 258 (44,3 %) den Fragebogen aus. Die Umfrage ist die erste umfassende Erhebung zur Erfassung von Publikationskosten in Deutschland.\nDie Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Mehrzahl der Befragten Publikationskosten zumindest teilweise erfassen. Die Abläufe sind jedoch nicht überall verbindlich geregelt. 33,1 % der Befragten gaben an, dass Publikationskosten an ihrer Einrichtung dezentral an mehreren Abteilungen in mehreren Systemen erfasst werden. Durchschnittlich sind 2,4 Bereiche einer Einrichtung in die Prozesse involviert. 66,3 % der Befragten bewerteten die Zusammenarbeit der beteiligten Einrichtungen als “sehr gut” oder “eher gut”. schätzen die Erfassung je nach Mittelherkunft unterschiedlich zuverlässig ein, am zuverlässigsten wird der Einsatz von Mitteln bewertet, die von einer zentralen Serviceeinrichtung verwaltet werden. 80,2 % bewerteten den Beitrag der Erfassung von Publikationskosten für die Gestaltung der Open-Access-Transformation als “sehr wichtig” oder “eher wichtig”. Die erfassten Daten sind jedoch nicht an allen Einrichtungen Grundlage strategischer Entscheidungen. Die Umsetzung eines Informationsbudgets bis 2025 wird an den meisten Einrichtungen als unwahrscheinlich angesehen."

    "text": "Beschreibung\nVor dem Hintergrund der Definition expliziter Zielmarken für das Open-Access-Publikationsaufkommen durch das Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, einiger Bundesländer und verschiedener weiterer Stakeholder gewinnt Open-Access-Reporting weiter an Bedeutung. Gleichzeitig erschweren Umstände wie die komplexe Datenlage eine flächendeckende Implementierung von Verfahren, und es wird deutlich, dass das Erfassen des Publikationsaufkommens durch die Betrachtung weiterer Indikatoren ergänzt werden sollte, um den unterschiedlichen Typen von Hochschulen und deren fachlicher Ausrichtung besser gerecht zu werden.\nDieser interaktive Workshop richtet sich daher an Mitarbeitende an wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen, die an der Durchführung von Open-Access-Reporting interessiert sind.\nIm Workshop werden unterschiedliche Ansätze des Open-Access-Reportings beleuchtet und diskutiert sowie anhand praxisnaher Beispiele das konkrete Vorgehen bei der Berichterstattung vermittelt.\nDer Workshop wird mit kurzen Praxisberichten zu Open-Access-Reporting auf Länderebene basierend auf qualitativen und quantitativen Ansätzen durch das Open-Access-Büro Berlin und die Vernetzungs- und Kompetenzstelle Brandenburg eröffnet.\nAnschließend erhalten Teilnehmende anhand eigener Fragestellungen und Analyseszenarien einen Einblick in die Nutzung des Open Access Monitors 1 für das Reporting des Publikationsaufkommens ihrer Einrichtung sowie ergänzender Informationen zu Strategien und Services von wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen auf Basis des oa.atlas 2.\nAnhand vorbereiteter Impulse diskutieren Teilnehmende in Kleingruppen Chancen und Herausforderungen der vorgestellten Reporting-Ansätze, bevor die Ergebnisse kurz im Plenum vorgestellt werden.\nNach Abschluss des Workshops sind die Teilnehmenden mit verschiedenen Ansätzen des Open-Access-Reportings vertraut und in der Lage, den Open Access Monitor und den oa.atlas für die Erstellung eines Berichts über ihre Open-Access-Aktivitäten sowie das Publikationsaufkommen ihrer Einrichtung zu nutzen.\nAn dem Workshop können maximal 20 Personen (exklusive der Organisator:innen) teilnehmen.

    "text": "Beschreibung\nSowohl die Open-Access-Strategie des Bundesministeriums für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), als auch die Empfehlungen der Europäischen Kommission zu OA an die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten fordern wissenschaftliche Einrichtungen auf, die Transparenz rund um vertragliche Vereinbarungen mit Verlagen zu stärken. Auch die Allianz der deutschen Wissenschaftsorganisationen adressiert dieses Thema. In der Praxis wird diese Forderung jedoch bis auf wenige Ausnahmen (z. B. die Offenlegung der DEAL-Verträge) nicht umgesetzt. Während im Bereich der Publikationsgebühren mit der Initiative OpenAPC ein international beachteter Ansatz zur Offenlegung der Mittel geschaffen wurde, steht eine solche Initiative z. B. für Subskriptionskosten noch aus. Vor diesem Hintergrund strebt das DFG-Projekt Transform2Open eine nationale Transparenzinitiative an, die sowohl Subskriptions- als auch Transformations- und OA-Verträge adressiert. Von besonderem Interesse sind der Umgang mit Non-Disclosure-Agreements und aktuelle Hindernisse für Transparenzbestrebungen. Auch praktische Verfahren zur Offenlegung von Kosten sind ein wichtiges Thema. Mit den Bestrebungen zur Öffnung von Forschungsinformationen, z. B. im Rahmen der Initiative „Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information“, ergeben sich darüber hinaus neue Möglichkeiten der Zusammenführung von Daten über Publikationen und ihre Kosten. Unter dem Tagungsmotto „Gemeinsame Infrastrukturen für eine offene Wissenschaft“ der 25. Jahrestagung der Deutschen Initiative für Netzwerkinformation (DINI) am 19. September 2024 in Potsdam wurden im Rahmen eines World-Café-Workshops thematisiert, welche Aspekte und Einrichtungen für eine prototypische Implementierung einer Transparenzinitiative zunächst fokussiert werden sollten. Gemeinsam wurden Herausforderungen bei der Umsetzung identifiziert, um die Umsetzung in die Praxis vorzubereiten. Der Workshop wurde gemeinsam von den DFG-Projekten Transform2Open und OA Datenpraxis angeboten. OA Datenpraxis unterstützt die Strukturbildung für die Open-Access-Transformation auf nationaler Ebene. Eine enge Zusammenarbeit mit Akteur:innen aus dem Projekt DEAL, OpenAPC, openCost und dem OA-Monitor besteht bzw. wird weiter ausgebaut."

    "text": "Analyzing and visualizing open access payments\nIn the following sections, we will analyze the data to address our questions and generate visualizations.\nHow much did the institution spend on open access publications in total?\nTo determine total open access spending of the research organization, we are using the sum function and apply it to the colum euro. The OpenAPC schema states that this column contains “[t]he APC amount that was paid in EURO. Includes VAT and any discounts”.\n\nsum(df$euro)\n\n[1] 8669107\n\n\nWithout context, this number does not say much. Applying the min and max functions to the column period (“Year of APC payment (YYYY)”), we can see that this sum was accrued over a period of 6 years, from 2018 to 2023.\n\nmin(df$period)\n\n[1] 2018\n\nmax(df$period)\n\n[1] 2023\n\n\nBecause it takes research organizations time to collect and process data on APC payments and submit it to OpenAPC, there is usually a delay in reporting. In this example, data for 2024 is not yet available.\nHow are payments distributed across journals?\nThe R package dplyr provides a lot of functionality for data wrangling. We can’t go into much detail here, but we will demonstrate how to use some of the most useful functions.\nOne of them is the group_by function. Here, we use it to group the dataset by the column journal_full_title. This will allow us to generate aggregate statistics for articles published within a journal. We then use the pipe operator |&gt;, which takes output from one function as input for the next function. The input is passed to the summarise function, where we calculate aggregate statistics. For each journal in the dataset, we calculate the total number of articles published (n_articles), the total of APCs paid (sum_apc), the average APC paid per article (avg_apc), and the standard deviation (sd_apc). The last two statistics are rounded to two decimal places. To get a better overview of the data, we then use arrange to sort the result by the total number of articles.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(journal_full_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    n_articles = n(),\n    sum_apc = sum(euro),\n    avg_apc = round(sum_apc / n_articles, 2),\n    sd_apc = round(sd(euro), 2)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n_articles))\n\n# A tibble: 923 × 5\n   journal_full_title                          n_articles sum_apc avg_apc sd_apc\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                            &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Scientific Reports                                 232 433492.   1868.   141.\n 2 PLOS ONE                                           134 223456.   1668.   210.\n 3 Frontiers in Immunology                            130 276129.   2124.   516.\n 4 International Journal of Molecular Sciences        124 222282.   1793.   331.\n 5 Journal of Clinical Medicine                       120 212463.   1771.   502.\n 6 Frontiers in Neurology                              70 144595.   2066.   558.\n 7 Cancers                                             66 118423.   1794.   557.\n 8 Allergy                                             61 168277.   2759.   623.\n 9 Frontiers in Psychiatry                             60 128626.   2144.   638.\n10 Frontiers in Physiology                             43  91332    2124    474.\n# ℹ 913 more rows\n\n\nThe results show that Charité paid APCs for 923 journals, as indicated by the number of rows. Most APC payments were made to the journals Scientific Reports, PLOS ONE, and Frontiers in Immunology. The column sd_apc tells us that for some journals, there is a considerable variance in APC payments.\nWe can explore this variance further by visualizing the distribution of APC payments. For this, we will use the packages dplyr and ggplot2. First, we filter the data to focus on the three journals with the most APC payments. We then pass this output to the ggplot function. We assign the column euro to the x axis and the column journal_full_title to the y axis. Next, we define the type of plot we want - here, we choose a box plot to visualize a distribution. Finally, we choose the theme theme_minimal for a simple layout.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(journal_full_title %in% c(\"Scientific Reports\", \"PLOS ONE\", \"Frontiers in Immunology\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = euro, y = journal_full_title)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese box plots show clear differences in the distribution of APC payments. The three journals differ in the median amount of APCs paid - the median is the middle point in a distribution and is visualized by the vertical line in the box plot. We also see that the range of APC payments is highest for Frontiers in Immunology: there are outliers at the bottom and top end of the distribution, as indicated by the dots.\nHow do payments evolve over the years?\nWe can combine dplyr and ggplot2 to visualize the development of APC payments over time. We will also consider open access types (gold / hybrid).\nFirst, we group the data by period (“Year of APC payment (YYYY)”) and is_hybrid (“Determines if the article has been published in a hybrid journal (TRUE) or in fully/Gold OA journal (FALSE)”). Just like above, we will generate the aggregate statistic n_articles. In the ggplot function, we assign the column period to the x axis, n_articles to the y axis, and is_hybrid to fill - this means that different colours will be assigned to the open access types. We choose the graph type geom_col, a simple bar chart.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(period, is_hybrid) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_articles = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = n_articles, fill = is_hybrid)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot tells us that the number of APC payments has increased between 2018 and 2021 and has dropped off since. We can also see that APC payments for publications in hybrid open access journals have increased considerably between 2019 and 2020. This is likely the result of transformative agreements between German research organizations and publishers."

    "text": "Institutionelle oder Hochschulrankings genießen eine hohe Aufmerksamkeit in Wissenschaftspolitik und Öffentlichkeit, weil es ihnen gelingt, wissenschaftliche Einrichtungen auf globaler Ebene übersichtlich miteinander zu vergleichen. Sie dienen verschiedenen Interessengruppen, wie politischen Entscheidungsträgern, Hochschulmanagern oder Studieninteressierten, unter anderem als Instrument zur strategischen Entscheidungsfindung, Veranschaulichung der institutionellen Exzellenz oder bei der Wahl des Studienorts (Waltman et al., 2012). Die jeweilige Methodik, auf der die Rankings basieren, ist mitunter vielzähliger Kritikpunkte ausgesetzt, beispielsweise wegen ihrer Tendenz, mehrere Dimensionen des Leistungsspektrums wissenschaftlicher Einrichtungen zu einer einzigen, oft undurchsichtigen Punktzahl zusammenzufassen (Diprose et al., 2023; Piro & Sivertsen, 2016; van Raan, 2005). Dieser Ansatz erschwert nicht nur die Interpretation der Rankings, sondern berücksichtigt auch nicht hinreichend die unterschiedlichen Aufgaben und Prioritäten der Einrichtungen (Huang, Neylon, Brookes-Kenworthy, et al., 2020; Waltman et al., 2012).\nIn den letzten Jahren hat die Einbeziehung von Open-Access-Kennzahlen in Hochschulrankings an Bedeutung gewonnen. Open Access bezeichnet den freien und uneingeschränkten Online-Zugang zu Forschungsergebnissen (Suber, 2012) und ist zu einem wichtigen Indikator für das Engagement einer wissenschaftlichen Einrichtung für eine offene und transparante Wissenschaftspraxis geworden. Diese Entwicklung wird zusätzlich durch die Vorgaben von Förderorganisationen unterstützt, die Open Access zunehmend als Voraussetzung für die Forschungsförderung betrachten (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 2025; Fournier, 2017; Huang, Neylon, Hosking, et al., 2020; National Institutes of Health, 2024; Rücknagel, 2021; Wellcome, 2025). Diese Vorgaben setzen neben dem Selbstverständnis vieler Einrichtungen einen zusätzlichen Anreiz Forschungsergebnisse im Open Access zugänglich zu machen. Die Integration von Open-Access-Kennzahlen in Hochschulrankings ermöglicht den Aktivitäten der Einrichtungen im Bereich Open Access Rechnung zu tragen und bietet eine zusätzliche Vergleichsdimension (Diprose et al., 2023).\nEs konnten fünf institutionelle Rankings mit Open Access als Vergleichsdimension identifiziert werden: das Leiden Ranking 2024 (LR), das Leiden Ranking Open Edition 2024 (LROE), das SCImago Institutions Ranking 2024 (SIR), das Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings: Sustainability 2025 (QS) und das COKI OA Dashboard 2025 (COKI). Alle fünf Rankings enthalten einen oder mehrere Open-Access-Indikatoren und sind hinsichtlich ihrer geografischen Abdeckung global ausgerichtet.\nDiese Seite bietet eine Übersicht über die Charakteristika der fünf Rankings, sowie eine Untersuchung dazu, inwieweit die Ergebnisse der Rankings miteinander vergleichbar sind. Dies beinhaltet unter anderem einen Vergleich der von den Rankings verwendeten Datenquellen und Open-Access-Indikatoren, sowie eine Erhebung dazu, in welchem Umfang sich die Einrichtungen an der Datenerhebung durch die Rankinganbieter beteiligen können. Der Fokus liegt dabei insbesondere auf der Open-Access-Dimension."

Am Ende jedes Abschnitts werden Details zu den Rankings in einem aufklappbaren Textkasten mit der Überschrift „Ranking-Details“ zusammengefasst. Dazu gehört insbesondere eine umfassende Liste der in jedem Ranking verwendeten Open-Access-Indikatoren.\n\nLeiden Ranking\nDas Leiden Ranking wird seit 2007 jährlich vom Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) der Universität Leiden in den Niederlanden erstellt (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-e; Waltman et al., 2012). Das Ranking bietet keine klassische Rangliste, bei der eine Gesamtkennzahl berechnet wird, jedoch verschiedene bibliometrische Indikatoren entlang der Dimensionen scientific impact, collaboration, Open Access und gender. Die Indikatoren werden sowohl in größenabhängiger (absolute Zahlen) als auch in größenunabhängiger (relative Anteile) Form dargestellt, um Unterschiede in der Größe der Universitäten zu berücksichtigen. Das Ranking bietet auch Trendanalysen über Zeiträume und Stabilitätsintervalle, um statistische Unsicherheiten zu berücksichtigen (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-c, n.d.-a).\nDie Version 2024 des Leiden Ranking umfasst bibliometrische Daten für 1.506 Universitäten weltweit (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-a). Indikatoren werden jeweils für Zeiträume von vier Jahren angegeben, die Version 2024 erweitert diese um den Zeitraum 2019–2022 (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-a). Die bibliographischen Daten stammen aus dem Web of Science, wobei jedoch nur Artikel und Reviews berücksichtigt werden, die in internationalen wissenschaftlichen Zeitschriften veröffentlicht wurden (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-a). Die Auswahl der Universitäten erfolgt auf der Grundlage ihrer Forschungsleistung, wobei diese mindestens 800 sogenannte core publications vorweisen müssen, um in das Ranking aufgenommen zu werden. Unter core publications werden Veröffentlichungen verstanden, die in internationalen wissenschaftlichen Zeitschriften in solchen Feldern veröffentlicht wurden, die für die Zitationsanalyse geeignet sind. Diese Publikationen müssen in englischer Sprache verfasst sein, mindestens eine:n Autor:in haben, dürfen nicht zurückgezogen (retracted) worden sein und müssen in einem sogenannten core journal erschienen sein. core journals zeichnen sich durch ihre internationale Ausrichtung aus und müssen in einem Feld angesiedelt sein, das für die Zitationsanalyse geeignet ist. Das Leiden Ranking verwendet keine Daten, die direkt von Universitäten stammen (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-a, n.d.-c).\nEin wesentliches Merkmal des Leiden Ranking ist der Fokus auf Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen. Mit der Version 2019 des Rankings wurden Indikatoren zum Open-Access-Publizieren hinzugefügt (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-e). Um den Open-Access-Status von Publikationen zu bestimmen, nutzt das Leiden Ranking OpenAlex als Datenquelle (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-a, n.d.-c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRanking Details\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 2024\nWebsite: https://www.leidenranking.com/\nErsteller: Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)\nRanking Typ: Hochschulranking\nSektoren: Hochschulen\nLink zur Methodik: https://traditional.leidenranking.com/Content/CWTS%20Leiden%20Ranking%202024.pdf\nDatenquellen: Web of Science (Publikationen), OpenAlex (Open Access Status)\nDimension mit Open Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung): Open Access\nOpen Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung):\n\nGesamtzahl der Veröffentlichungen einer Universität\nAnzahl und Anteil der Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen einer Universität\nAnzahl und Anteil der Gold-Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen einer Universität\nAnzahl und Anteil der Hybrid-Open-Access-Publikationen einer Universität\nDie Anzahl und der Anteil der Bronze-Open-Access-Publikationen einer Universität\nDie Anzahl und der Anteil der grünen Open-Access-Publikationen einer Universität\nDie Anzahl und der Anteil der Publikationen einer Universität, deren Open-Access-Status unbekannt ist\n\nPublikations-/Update-Rythmus: jährlich\nAnzahl an Institutionen: 1.506 Hochschulen\nGeographische Abdeckung: global\nDarstellung: Multi-Indikatoren Ranking\nDatenverfügbarkeit: Ergebnisdaten verfügbar unter CC-BY Lizenz: Van Eck (2024a)\n\n\n\n\n\nLeiden Ranking Open Edition\nDas Leiden Ranking Open Edition wird seit 2024 (Waltman et al., 2024) jährlich vom Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) der Universität Leiden in den Niederlanden erstellt. Es ist eine annähernde Reproduktion des traditionellen Leiden Ranking unter Nutzung offener Datenquellen (Waltman et al., 2024) und bietet ebenfalls keine klassische Rangliste, sondern verschiedene bibliometrische Indikatoren entlang der Dimensionen scientific impact, collaboration, und Open Access. Die Indikatoren werden in der Open Edition ebenfalls sowohl in größenabhängiger (absolute Zahlen) als auch in größenunabhängiger (relative Anteile) Form dargestellt, um Unterschiede in der Größe der Universitäten zu berücksichtigen. Die Open Edition des Leiden Ranking bietet zudem ebenfalls Trendanalysen über Zeiträume und Stabilitätsintervalle, um statistische Unsicherheiten zu berücksichtigen (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b, n.d.-f).\nDie Version 2024 des Leiden Ranking umfasst bibliometrische Daten für 1.506 Universitäten weltweit (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b). Indikatoren werden jeweils für Zeiträume von vier Jahren angegeben, die Version 2024 erweitert diese um den Zeitraum 2019–2022 (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b). Die bibliographischen Daten stammen aus OpenAlex, wobei jedoch nur sogenannte core publications berücksichtigt werden (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b). Im Vergleich zum traditionellen Leiden Ranking zählen in der Open Edition zusätzlich Publikationen vom Typ Buchkapitel, die in Buchreihen veröffentlicht wurden zu den core publications. Ferner müssen alle Publikationen nicht nur Autor:innenangaben, sondern auch Affiliationsangaben und Referenzen enthalten, um zu den core publications zu zählen. Alle anderen Kriterien für die core publications und core journals sind deckungsgleich zum traditionellen Leiden Ranking (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b).\nAuch das Leiden Ranking Open Edition legt einen Fokus auf Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen und bietet weitestgehend die selben Open-Access-Indikatoren wie das traditionelle Leiden Ranking, mit Ausnahme der Indikatoren zu Publikationen mit unklarem Open-Access-Status (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b). Darüber hinaus weist das Leiden Ranking Open Edition die Besonderheit auf, dass auf der Weboberfläche die den Indikatoren zugrunde liegenden Publikationen einsehen werden können (van Eck, Waltman, et al., 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRanking Details\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 2024\nWebsite: https://www.open.leidenranking.com/\nErsteller: Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)\nRanking Typ: Hochschulranking\nSektoren: Hochschulen\nLink zur Methodik: https://open.leidenranking.com/Content/CWTS%20Leiden%20Ranking%20Open%20Edition%202024.pdf\nDatenquellen: OpenAlex\nDimension mit Open Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung): Open Access\nOpen Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung):\n\nGesamtzahl der Veröffentlichungen einer Universität\nAnzahl und Anteil der Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen einer Universität\nAnzahl und Anteil der Gold-Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen einer Universität\nAnzahl und Anteil der Hybrid-Open-Access-Publikationen einer Universität\nDie Anzahl und der Anteil der Bronze-Open-Access-Publikationen einer Universität\nDie Anzahl und der Anteil der grünen Open-Access-Publikationen einer Universität\n\nPublikations-/Update-Rythmus: jährlich\nAnzahl an Institutionen: 1.506 Hochschulen\nGeographische Abdeckung: global\nDarstellung: Multi-Indikatoren Ranking\nDatenverfügbarkeit: Rohdaten und Ergebnisdaten verfügbar unter CC0 Lizenz:\n\nRohdaten: Van Eck (2024b)\nErgebnisdaten: Van Eck (2024c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCImago Institutions Ranking\nDas SCImago Institutions Ranking wird seit 2009 jährlich von der SCImago Research Group erstellt (Rousseau et al., 2018). Das Ranking bietet eine klassische Rangliste (league table) von wissenschaftlichen und forschungsnahen Einrichtungen anhand eines zusammengesetzten Indikators auf einer Skala zwischen 0 und 100. Der zusammengesetzte Indikator kombiniert Bewertungen entlang dreier Dimensionen: Forschung, Innovation und gesellschaftliche Wirkung. Der zusammengesetzte Indikator ergibt sich aus einer gewichtete Kombination von Metriken entlang dieser Dimensionen, wobei sowohl größenabhängige als auch größenunabhängige Metriken verwendet werden. Für jede Einrichtung bietet das Ranking zusätzlich noch eine Reihe von Grafiken beispielsweise zu der Rangentwicklung über die Zeit, Vergleichen auf nationaler, regionaler oder globaler Ebene, oder ähnlichen Institutionen gemäß des Publikationsprofils (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-a).\nDie Version 2025 des SCImago Institutions Ranking umfasst Daten für 9.756 Institutionen weltweit (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-b). Der zusammengesetzte Indikator wird pro Jahr für einen Zeitraum von fünf Jahren bis zwei Jahre vor Veröffentlichung des Rankings angegeben, für die Version 2025 also für den Zeitraum 2019–2023. Die bibliographischen Daten stammen aus Scopus. Die Auswahl der Institutionen erfolgt auf der Grundlage ihrer Veröffentlichungsleistung. Im letzten Jahr des betrachteten Zeitraums müssen die Institutionen mindestens 100 in Scopus indexierte Publikationen veröffentlicht haben, um in das Ranking aufgenommen zu werden. Ferner müssen mindestens 75% des gesamten Publikationsvolumens einer Einrichtung sogenannte zitierfähige Dokumente ausmachen. Zu den zitierfähigen Dokumenten werden für das SCImago Institutions Ranking die Publikationstypen Artikel, Buchkapitel, Konferenzbeiträge, Reviews und Short Surveys gezählt (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-a).\nInnerhalb der Forschungsdimension, die mit 50% in den zusammengesetzten Indikator einfließt, wurde mit der Version 2019 ein Open-Access-Indikator dem Ranking hinzugefügt. Dieser geht mit 2% Gewichtung in die Forschungsdimension ein und misst den Prozentsatz der Dokumente, die in Open-Access-Zeitschriften veröffentlicht wurden oder in Unpaywall indexiert sind. Um den Open-Access-Status von Publikationen zu bestimmen, nutzt das SCImago Institutions Ranking Unpaywall als Datenquelle (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRanking Details\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 2025\nWebsite: https://www.scimagoir.com/\nErsteller: SCImago Research Group\nRanking Typ: Institutionenranking\nSektoren: Behörden, Hochschulen, Unternehmen, Gesundheitsorganisationen, Non-Profit Organisationen\nLink zur Methodik: https://www.scimagoir.com/methodology.php\nDatenquellen: Scopus (Publikationen), Unpaywall (Open Access Status)\nDimension mit Open Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung): Research (50%)\nOpen Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung): Prozentualer Anteil der Dokumente, die in Open-Access-Zeitschriften veröffentlicht oder in Unpaywall indexiert sind (2%)\nPublikations-/Update-Rythmus: jährlich\nAnzahl an Institutionen: 9.756 Hochschulen und forschungsnahe Einrichtungen\nGeographische Abdeckung: global\nDarstellung: Rangliste (league table)\nDatenverfügbarkeit: Ergebnisdaten verfügbar über die Ranking Website, keine Lizenzangabe: https://www.scimagoir.com/rankings.php\n\n\n\n\n\nQS Sustainability Ranking\nDas QS World University Rankings: Sustainability wird seit 2023 jährlich von Quacquarelli Symonds erstellt, nachdem bereits 2022 eine Pilotversion veröffentlicht wurde (Quacquarelli Symonds, 2024). Das Ranking bietet eine klassische Rangliste (league table) von Hochschulen anhand eines zusammengesetzten Indikators sowohl für die einzelnen Kategorien und Unterkategorien (Lenses), als auch eine Gesamtpunktzahl. Dabei werden die kategorialen Punktzahlen für alle bewerteten Institutionen angezeigt, während die Gesamtpunktzahlen nur bis zu einem bestimmten Punkt angezeigt und danach ausgeblendet werden (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-a). Das QS World University Rankings: Sustainability bewertet Institutionen entlang dreier Dimensionen: Environmental Impact, Social Impact, und Governance.\nDie Version 2025 des QS World University Rankings: Sustainability umfasst Daten für 1.744 Hochschulen weltweit (Quacquarelli Symonds, 2024). Die bibliographischen Daten stammen aus Scopus und bilden einen 5-jahres Zeitraum ab (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-d). Es werden dabei ausschließlich die Publikationstypen Artikel, Review, Konferenzbeitrag, Buch, Buchkapitel, Article in Press und Business Article berücksichtigt (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-e, n.d.-f). Institutionen werden nur in das QS World University Rankings: Sustainability aufgenommen, wenn sie einerseits Eignungskriterien für die Aufnahme in mindestens eines der Rankings QS World University Rankings, QS Rankings by Region oder QS Rankings by Subject erfüllen und zusätzlich noch eine Punktzahl ungleich Null für spezifische Indikatoren innerhalb der Environmental Impact und Social Impact erreichen (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-g).\nInnerhalb der Governance-Dimension, die mit 10% in die Gesamtpunktzahl einfließt, bildet ein Indikator Open-Access-Publikationen ab. Dieser geht mit 1% Gewichtung in die Governance-Dimension ein und misst den Anteil an Open-Access-Publikationen am gesamten Publikationvolumen. Der Anteil wird einzeln für die sechs berücksichtigten Felder berechnet und zu einer gewichteten Summe aggregiert. Gold- und Hybrid-Publikationen werden bei der Berechnung stärker gewichtet als Publikationen, die über den grünen Open-Access-Weg veröffentlicht wurden. Um den Open-Access-Status von Publikationen zu bestimmen, nutzt das QS World University Rankings: Sustainability Unpaywall als Datenquelle (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRanking Details\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 2025\nWebsite: https://www.topuniversities.com/sustainability-rankings\nErsteller: Quacquarelli Symonds Ltd.\nRanking Typ: Hochschulranking\nSektoren: Hochschulen\nLink zur Methodik: https://support.qs.com/hc/en-gb/articles/8551503200668-QS-World-University-Rankings-Sustainability\nDatenquellen: Scopus (Publikationen), Unpaywall (Open Access Status)\nDimension mit Open Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung): Governance (10%)\nOpen Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung): Der Anteil der gesamten Forschungsergebnisse einer Einrichtung, die laut Unpaywall als Open Access verfügbar sind (1%)\nPublikations-/Update-Rythmus: jährlich\nAnzahl an Institutionen: 1.744 Hochschulen\nGeographische Abdeckung: global\nDarstellung: Rangliste (league table)\nDatenverfügbarkeit: Ergebnisdaten verfügbar über die Ranking Website nach Registrierung, keine Lizenzangabe: https://www.topuniversities.com/sustainability-rankings\n\n\n\n\n\nCOKI OA Dashboard\nDas COKI Open Access Dashboard wird seit 2022 von der Curtin Open Knowledge Intitiative erstellt (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, 2022; Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative & Wilson, 2022). Das Dashboard ist kein klassisches Ranking, jedoch lassen sich Institutionen und Länder nach dem Open Access Anteil sowie den gesamten und Open-Access-Publikationsvolumina sortieren (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, 2022). Das Dashboard zeigt ferner für die einzelnen Länder und Institutionen an, über welche Plattform die Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen verfügbar gemacht werden, sowohl aggregiert über den gesamten Publikationszeitraum, als auch aufgeschlüsselt für die einzelnen Publikationsjahre (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, 2022).\nDie Version vom 18.08.2025 des COKI Open Access Dashboard umfasst Daten für 227 Länder und 56.187 Institutionen weltweit (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c). Die bibliographischen Daten stammen aus mehreren offenen Datenquellen und berücksichtigen den Publikationszeitraum 2000–2024, zur Identifikation von Publikationen wird insbesondere Crossref genutzt (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c, n.d.-d). Die Auswahl der Publikationstypen ist im Vergleich zu den anderen Rankings weniger restriktiv, ausgeschlossen werden lediglich Publikationen mit den Typen Datensätze, Datenbanken, Komponenten, Berichtskomponenten, Peer Reviews, Fördermittel, Tagungsbände, Zeitschriftenausgaben, Berichtsreihen, Buchverzeichnisse, sowie alle Publikationen ohne angegebenen Publikationstyp (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c). Institutionen müssen mindestens 50 Publikationen aufweisen, um in das COKI Open Access Dashboard aufgenommen zu werden, es sei denn, die Institutionen waren bereits im Datensatz aufgenommen, als dieser noch auf Microsoft Academic Graph basierte (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c).\nDas COKI Open Access Dashboard legt den Fokus ausschließlich auf Open-Access-Aktivitäten der Institutionen und Länder. Während in der Listenansicht vorwiegend die absolute Anzahl sowie den prozentuale Anteil an Open-Access-Veröffentlichungen dargestellt wird, zeigen Detailansichten zu einzelnen Institutionen und Ländern differenziertere Aufschlüsselungen zu Publikationsaktivitäten und -orten, ergänzt durch Visualisierungen (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-d). Um den Open-Access-Status von Publikationen zu bestimmen, nutzt das COKI Open Access Dashboard Unpaywall als Datenquelle (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRanking Details\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 18.08.2025\nWebsite: https://open.coki.ac/\nErsteller: Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative\nRanking Typ: Länder- und Institutionen-Ranking\nSektoren: Förderorganisationen, Behörden, Hochschulen, Unternehmen, Gesundheitsorganisationen, Non-Profit Organisationen, Infrastrukturorganisationen, Archive, Sonstige\nLink zur Methodik: https://open.coki.ac/how/\nDatenquellen: Crossref (Publikationen), Unpaywall (Open Access Status)\nDimension mit Open Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung): –\nOpen Access Indikatoren (Gewichtung):\n\nProzentualer Anteil an Open Access Veröffentlichungen\nGesamtanzahl der Veröffentlichungen\nGesamtanzahl an Open Access Veröffentlichungen\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über den Verlag Open Access zugänglich sind\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über andere Platformen Open Access zugänglich sind (Repositorien, Preprint-Server, etc.)\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die sowohl über den Verlag, als auch über andere Platformen Open Access zugänglich sind\nProzentualer Anteil an Closed Artikeln\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die in einer Open Access Zeitschrift veröffentlicht wurden\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die in einer Hybrid Zeitschrift\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über den Verlag ohne Wiederverwendungsrechte Open Access sind\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über institutionelle Repositorien Open Access sind\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über Preprint Server Open Access sind\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über Fachrepositorien Open Access sind\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über anderweitige, öffentliche Repositorien Open Access sind\nProzentualer Anteil an Artikeln, die über anderweitige Webseiten oder Portale Open Access sind\n\nPublikations-/Update-Rythmus: regelmäßig\nAnzahl an Institutionen: 56.187 Institutionen\nGeographische Abdeckung: global\nDarstellung: Multi-Indikatoren Dashboard\nDatenverfügbarkeit: Ergebnisdaten verfügbar über die Ranking Website unter CC-BY Lizenz: Hosking et al.

    "text": "Vergleichbarkeit der Ranking-Ergebnisse\nUm zu beurteilen, wie vergleichbar die Ergebnisse der ausgewählten Rankings sind, konzentrieren sich die nachfolgenden Abschnitte auf die Überprüfung folgender Aspekte: die von den Rankings verwendeten Datenquellen, die von den Rankings verwendeten Open-Access-Indikatoren und deren Gewichtung, die Anzahl der in allen Rankings vertretenen Institutionen, die geografische Verteilung der Institutionen über Länder und Weltregionen hinweg sowie die Möglichkeit der institutionellen Beteiligung am Datenerhebungsprozess der Ranking-Anbieter.\nEs soll dabei herausgearbeitet werden, inwiefern sich die einzelnen Rankingsysteme unterscheiden und welche Auswirkungen dies mitunter für die Nutzung eines bestimmten Rankings bei Open-Access-Monitoringaktivitäten oder der strategischen Entscheidungsfindung haben kann.\n\nDatenquellen\nIn diesem Abschnitt werden die von den fünf Rankings verwendeten Datenquellen untersucht, wobei der Fokus auf folgenden zwei Kategorien von Datenquellen liegt: zum einen Datenquellen, die zur Erhebung bibliografischer Daten verwendet werden, und zum anderen Datenquellen, die zur Bestimmung des Open-Access-Status herangezogen werden. Unterschiede in der Abdeckung, Vollständigkeit und Methodik dieser Datenquellen können zu Abweichungen bei der Berechnung von Metriken führen und somit die Vergleichbarkeit der Ergebnisse unterschiedlicher Rankings einschränken. Ferner wird untersucht, ob sich aufgrund der verwendeten Datenquellen disziplinäre Unterschiede zwischen den Rankings ergeben.\n\nBibliographische Datenquellen\n\n\n\nTabelle 1: Verwendete Datenquellen für die Erhebung bibliographischer Daten\n\n\n\n\n\nRanking\nWeb of Science\nScopus\nOpenAlex\nCrossref\n\n\n\n\nLeiden Ranking\nx\n\n\n\n\n\nLeiden Ranking Open Edition\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nSCImago Institutions Ranking\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nQS Sustainability Ranking\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nCOKI OA Dashboard\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen-Access-Datenquellen\n\n\n\nTabelle 2: Verwendete Datenquellen für die Bestimmung des Open-Access-Status\n\n\n\n\n\nRanking\nUnpaywall\nOpenAlex\n\n\n\n\nLeiden Ranking\n\nx\n\n\nLeiden Ranking Open Edition\n\nx\n\n\nSCImago Institutions Ranking\nx\n\n\n\nQS Sustainability Ranking\nx\n\n\n\nCOKI OA Dashboard\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisziplinäre Unterschiede\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbildung 1: Disziplinäre Unterschiede zwischen dem traditionellen Leiden Ranking 2024 und dem Leiden Ranking Open Edition 2024 (Quelle: Open Dashboard 2024, (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-d))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen-Access-Indikatoren\nInnerhalb der evaluativen Bibliometrie konzentrieren sich sogenannte Produktivitätsindikatoren auf die Auszählung von Publikationsvolumina, um die Produktivität von Einzelpersonen, Institutionen oder Ländern zu quantifizieren (Gauch2023?). Open-Access-Indikatoren lassen sich in diesem Zusammenhang als eine Form von Produktivitätsindikatoren verstehen, da sie meist die Anzahl an Open-Access-Publikationen auszählen und daraus ein approximierendes Maß für die Produktivität von Forschenden, Institutionen oder Ländern im Bereich Open Access generieren.\nAus einer guten bibliometrischen Praxis heraus, wie sie etwa im Leiden Manifest (Hicks2015?) umrissen ist, erfordert die Auswahl der im Kontext von Rankings verwendeten Indikatoren sorgfältige Überlegungen bezüglich deren Eignung für den Vergleich von Institutionen. Ein Vergleich zwischen Einrichtungen aus unterschiedlichen regionalen Kontexten oder mit unterschiedlicher Anzahl an Forschenden und Publikationsvolumina kann problematisch sein, wenn die Indikatoren lediglich absolute Anzahlen an Publikationen darstellen, da die spezifischen Bedingungen und Herausforderungen jeder Einrichtung nicht berücksichtigt werden. Um eine bessere Vergleichbarkeit zwischen Einrichtungen zu schaffen, finden daher bei der Indikatorenkonstruktion verschiedene Formen der Normalisierung Anwendung (Gauch2023?). Eine Form der Normalisierung in Bezug auf Open-Access-Indikatoren kann sein, die absolute Anzahl der Open-Access-Publikationen einer Einrichtung ins Verhältnis zu setzen zur absoluten Anzahl aller Publikationen einer Einrichtung im untersuchten Zeitraum.\nNeben einzelnen Indikatoren, werden auch sogenannte zusammengesetze Indikatoren (composite indicators) für einige Rankings verwendet, die als Rangliste angelegt sind. Diese Indikatoren werden aus gewichteten Aggregaten von einzelnen Indikatoren generiert (Glaenzel2009?; Johnes2018?). Die Idee hinter zusammengesetzten Indikatoren besteht darin, komplexe Phänomene wissenschaftlicher Aktivitäten durch die Kombination und Verdichtung verschiedener Indikatoren zu einem einzigen, umfassenden Maß abzubilden. Durch diese Art der Linearisierung in eine einzelne Metrik, die sich sortieren lässt, ermöglichen zusammengesetze Indikatoren eine einfachere Vergleichbarkeit zwischen Einrichtungen, Personen oder Ländern (quick_notes?). Dennoch gehen gewisse Problematiken mit zusammengesetzten Indikatoren einher, eine gute Übersicht findet sich bei (Forthmann2024?). Zu den Problematiken und Kritikpunkten gehören beispielsweise, dass die Auswahl der Gewichtung einzelner Komponenten bei zusammengesetzen Indikatoren oft undurchsichtig und teils willkürlich erfolgt. Dabei haben die Gewichte der Einzelkomponenten einen beachtlichen Einfluss auf das resultierende Ranking (Glaenzel2009?; Forthmann2024?). Ferner wird auch kritisiert, dass es oft an hinreichender Transparenz bezüglich der Indikatorenkonstruktion mangelt, was die Interpretation der Rankings erschweren kann (Forthmann2024?).\nBeide Versionen des Leiden Rankings bieten im Kern zwei Arten von Open-Access-Indikatoren: 1) Indikatoren, die das Gesamtpublikationsvolumen an Open-Access-Publikationen einer Hochschule über einen vier-Jahreszeitraum ausweisen und 2) Indikatoren, die den Anteil des Open-Access-Publikationsvolumens am Gesamtpublikationsvolumen einer Hochschule über einen vier-Jahreszeitraum ausweisen. Beide Indikatoren werden einmal insgesamt für die Open-Access-Publikationen ausgewiesen und zusätzlich noch einmal separat für die gängigen Open-Access-Statustypen (gold, hybrid, grün, bronze, sowie für das traditionelle Leiden Ranking unknown). Neben den Open-Access-Indikatoren wird auch das Gesamtpublikationsvolumen pro Einrichtung angegeben. Auch wenn ein Vergleich zwischen Einrichtungen anhand absoluter Anzahlen Limitationen hat, so kann es doch sinnvoll sein, absolute Zahlen auszuweisen, um die Transparenz und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Indikatoren zu verbessern. Die Angabe der absoluten Anzahlen ermöglicht es den Einrichtungen, die Anteilswerte zu überprüfen und deren Genauigkeit zu beurteilen.\nÄhnlich wie die beiden Leiden Rankings, weist auch das COKI OA Dashboard sowohl absolute Anzahlen als auch relative Anteile in Bezug auf das Open-Access-Publikationsvolumen einer Einrichtung aus. Die im COKI OA Dashboard ausgewiesenen Indikatoren unterscheiden sich im Umfang zwischen der institutionellen Übersichtsseite und den Detailseiten der einzelnen Institutionen. Die Übersichtsseite, die einem Vergleich aller im COKI OA Dashboard repräsentierten Einrichtungen dient, weist dabei folgende Indikatoren für den Publikationszeitraum 2000–2024 aus: 1) den prozentualen Anteil an Open Access Veröffentlichungen, 2) ein gestapeltes Balkendiagramm welche die prozentualen Anteile an Artikeln visualisiert, die über den Verlag, andere Platformen, beides oder gar nicht im Open Access zugänglich sind. Das Balkendiagramm weist jedoch die jeweiligen Prozente nicht aus, 3) die Gesamtanzahl der Veröffentlichungen einer Einrichtung und 4) die Gesamtanzahl an Open Access Veröffentlichungen einer Einrichtung. Die Detailseiten der einzelnen Institutionen enthalten weitere spezifische Indikatoren, die eine detailliertere Übersicht des Open-Access-Publizierens einer Einrichtung ermöglichen. Insbesondere sind auf der Detailseite auch die Prozentangaben für das gestapelte Balkendiagramm angegeben und es werden unter anderem auch zeitliche Verläufe dargestellt. Auffällig ist, dass es eine Diskrepanz zwischen der Übersichtsseite und der Detailseite einer Einrichtung bezogen auf die absoluten Anzahlen für das Publikationsvolumen insgesamt und das Open-Access-Publikationsvolumen gibt. Auf der Übersichstsseite werden die exakten Werte angegeben, während auf der Detailsseite gerundete Werte dargestellt werden. Zudem handelt es sich bei dem Wert des prozentualen Open-Access-Anteils auf beiden Seiten um einen gerundeten Wert. Während die Angabe absoluter Zahlen, ähnlich zu den Leiden Rankings, für eine bessere Überprüfbarkeit der Indikatoren sorgt, ist die Darstellung gerundeter Werte weniger exakt.\nDas SCImago Institutions Ranking verwendet einen zusammengesetzten Indikator, der verschiedene Indikatoren aus den drei Bereichen Research, Innovation und Societal aggregiert. Die Research-Dimension geht mit 50% Gewicht in den zusammengesetzen Indikator ein und ist gegenüber den beiden anderen Dimension mit 30% (Innovation) und 20% (Societal) Gewichtung demnach deutlich stärker fokussiert. Der Open-Access-Indikator ist im SCImago Institutions Ranking Teil der Research-Dimension und geht mit einem Gewicht von 2% in diese ein. Er gehört damit zu den am wenigsten stark gewichteten Indikatoren innerhalb der Research-Dimension und des zusammengesetzen Indikators insgesamt. Der Open-Access-Indikator gibt den prozentualen Anteil der Publikationen an, die in Open-Access-Zeitschriften veröffentlicht oder in Unpaywall indexiert sind (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-a). Das SCImago Institutions Ranking weist aber weder den Open-Access-Indikator noch die von den Einrichtungen erreichte Gesamtpunktzahl aus, sondern gibt lediglich den resultierenden Rang an.\nÄhnlich wie das SCImago Institutions Ranking verwendet auch das QS Sustainability Ranking einen zusammengesetzten Indikator. Das QS Sustainability Ranking aggregiert dazu verschiedene Indikatoren aus den Bereichen Environmental Impact, Social Impact, und Governance. Die Governance-Dimension geht mit 10% Gewicht in den zusammengesetzen Indikator ein und ist damit im Gegensatz zur den Gewichtungn der beiden anderen Dimensionen mit jeweils 45 % deutlich weniger stark fokussiert. Der Open-Access-Indikator ist im QS Sustainability Ranking Teil der Governance-Dimension und geht mit einem Gewicht von 1% in diese ein. Alle Indikatoren innerhalb der Governance-Dimension haben das gleiche Gewicht zugewiesen, werden also gleichwertig für die Dimension berücksichtigt. Der Open-Access-Indikator gibt den Anteil der gesamten Forschungsergebnisse einer Einrichtung an, die laut Unpaywall als Open Access verfügbar sind (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-b). Bei der Indikatorenkonstruktion wird zwischen verschiedenen Open-Access-Statustypen (gold, hybrid, grün) und Feldern unterschieden, denen unterschiedliche Gewichtungen zugewiesen sind. Der finale Open-Access-Indikator wird anhand der einzelnen Werte pro Feld aggregiert und auf einen Wertebereich zwischen 0 und 100 skaliert (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-b). Der Datensatz QS Sustainability Ranking weist zusätzlich zur Gesamtpunktzahl für jede Dimension gesondert die erreichte Punktzahl aus. Die Gesamtpunktzahl wird dabei nur bis zum Rang 902 angegeben.\nInsgesamt ist erkennbar, dass sich die fünf Rankingsysteme teilweise stark in der Verwendung von Open-Access-Indikatoren unterscheiden, auch wenn alle beschriebenen Open-Access-Indikatoren die Produktivität von Einrichtungen in Bezug auf Open Access messen und darstellen. Unterschiede und Herausforderungen für die Vergleichbarkeit der Rankingergebnisse ergeben sich beispielsweise aus der Berücksichtigung verschiedener Open-Access-Statustypen (gold, hybrid, grün, etc.) zur Klassifikation von Open-Access-Publikationen. Hierbei ergibt sich auch eine Pfadabhängigkeit zu der verwendeten Datenquelle, anhand derer die Open-Access-Publikationen identifiziert werden. Beide Versionen des Leiden Ranking verwenden OpenAlex als Datenquelle zur Identifikation von Open-Access-Publikationen und weisen ferner die Open-Access-indikatoren gesondert für alle Open-Access-Statustypen aus. Das QS Sustainability Ranking hingegen stützt sich auf Unpaywall als Datenquelle, scheint jedoch nur zwischen goldenen, hybriden und grünen Open-Access-Publikationen zu unterscheiden (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-b). Das SCImago Institutions Ranking verwendet Unpaywall als Datenquelle, scheint jedoch keine Open-Access-Statustypen zu unterscheiden (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-a). Das COKI OA Dashboard verwendet ebenfalls Unpaywall als Datenquelle zur Identifikation von Open-Access-Publikationen, weist aber im vergleich zu den anderen Ranking nicht die typischen Open-Access-Statustypen mit ihren Farben aus. Vielmehr werden im COKI OA Dashboard goldene, hybride und bronze Publikationen zu der Kategorie Publisher Open zusammengefasst. Diese Unterschiede erschweren die Vergleichbarkeit zwischen den Rankingsystemen in Bezug auf Open Access.\nDurch die differenziertere Darstellung der Indikatoren verlangen beide Versionen des Leiden Ranking sowie das COKI OA Dashboard von den Nutzenden eine gesonderte Betrachtung der einzelnen Dimensionen, um eine umfassende Bewertung der Einrichtungen vornehmen zu können. Dies geht mit einer höheren Komplexität bei der Interpretation der Ergebnisse einher. Das SCImago Institutions Ranking und das QS SUstainability Ranking vereinfachen diese Komplexität durch die verwendeten zusammengesetzen Indikatoren. Allerdings erweisen sich die zusammengesetzen Indikatoren als weniger geeignet für das Open-Access-Monitoring und die Bewertung von Open-Access-Aktivitäten, da die spezifischen auf Open Access bezogenen Werte nicht direkt aus den zusammengesetzten Indikatoren abgeleitet werden können. Darüber hinaus spielen Open-Access-Indikatoren beim SCImago Institutions Ranking und dem QS Sustainability Ranking eine deutlich untergeordnete Rolle, da sie jeweils nur einen geringen Anteil an der Gesamtwertung ausmachen.\n\n\nÜberschneidung von Institutionen\nZur Bestimmung der institutionellen Überschneidungen zwischen den Rankings wurden zunächst die verfügbaren Ergebnisdaten der Rankings heruntergeladen1. Neben den Namen und Standorten (Länderangaben, teilweise auch Angaben zu Regionen und Unterregion) aller Institutionen, enthalten die Daten der beiden Versionen des Leiden Rankings sowie des COKI OA Dashboards auch Identifier aus dem Research Organization Registry (ROR). Darüber hinaus umfassen die Daten des COKI OA Dashboard und des SCImago Institutions Ranking Sektorenzuordnungen für alle in den Rankings abgebildeten Institutionen.\nUm identische Institutionen zwischen den Rankings anhand ihrer ROR-IDs eindeutig zuordnen zu können, mussten zunächst die Daten des SCImago Institutions Rankings und des QS Sustainability Rankings um ROR-IDs ergänzt werden. Dazu wurde der gesamte ROR-Datensatz in der Version 1.69 (Research Organization Registry, 2025) heruntergeladen. Anschließend wurde jeweils für beide Rankings ein maschineller Abgleich auf Basis der institutionellen Namensansetzung und der Länderangabe mit den ROR-Daten durchgeführt. Die QS Daten enthielten Einträge für insgesamt 1.743 Institutionen2, von denen 1.204 Institutionen mittels des maschinellen Abgleichs ROR-IDs zugeordnet werden konnten. Für die restlichen 539 Institutionen wurde eine manuelle Zuordnung der ROR-IDs vorgenommen, wobei allerdings für 7 Institutionen keine Zuordnung erfolgen konnte. Zur quantitativen Bestimmung der institutionellen Überschneidungen konnten demnach lediglich 1.736 Institutionen aus dem QS Sustainability Ranking berücksichtigt werden.\nSchwieriger gestaltete sich die Zuordnung von ROR-IDs zu den 9.755 im SCImago Institutions Ranking inkludierten Institutionen3. Über den maschinellen Abgleich auf Basis der institutionellen Namensansetzung und der Länderangabe konnten ROR-IDs lediglich zu 4.714 Institutionen zugeordnet werden. In Teilen könnte dies darauf zurückzuführen sein, dass das SCImago Institutions Ranking auch Institutionen listet, die als multinational gekennzeichnet sind (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-a). Dies scheint insbesondere Unternehmen zu betreffen, die überregional agieren, beispielsweise Google. Zwar bietet ROR auch IDs für Unternehmen (siehe Google), scheint dabei jedoch eindeutige Länderzuordnungen vorzunehmen. Die größere Schwierigkeit für den maschinellen Abgleich stellen jedoch vermutlich unterschiedliche Namensansetzungen zwischen dem SCImago Institutions Ranking und ROR dar4. Um die Abdeckung mit ROR-IDs für das SCImago Institutions Ranking zu erhöhen, wurde ein fuzzy matching Ansatz getestet, der auch alternative Namensformen und Akronyme aus dem ROR-Datensatz berücksichtigte. Das Ergebnis war jedoch nicht hinreichend genau und hätte einen hohen Datenbereinigungsaufwand erfordert. Insgesamt stellt dies eine deutliche Limitation für die Verwendbarkeit des SCImago-Datensatzes für eine globale Analyse der institutionellen Überschneidungen dar.\nAufgrund der Probleme bei der Zuordnung von ROR-IDs wurde entschieden, die Analyse der institutionellen Überschneidungen auf Einrichtungen aus Deutschland zu beschränken. Im Datensatz des QS Sustainability Ranking konnten insgesamt 50 Einrichtungen aus Deutschland identifiziert werden, von denen allen eine ROR-ID zugeordnet werden konnte. Im Datensatz des SCImago Institutions Ranking konnten insgesamt 364 Einrichtungen aus Deutschland identifiziert werden, von denen 342 keine ROR-ID über den maschinellen Abgleich zugeordnet werden konnten. Daher wurde eine manuelle Zuordnung vorgenommen, wobei jedoch für 6 der 342 Einrichtungen keine Zuordnung einer ROR-ID erfolgen konnte. Für die Analyse der institutionellen Überschneidungen deutscher Einrichtungen konnten demnach 385 Einrichtungen für das SCImago Institutions Ranking berücksichtigt werden.\nAbb. 2 stellt quantitativ die institutionellen Überschneidungen deutscher Einrichtungen zwischen den Rankings dar. Die Abbildung bezieht dabei nur die Institutionen ein, denen ROR-IDs zugeordnet werden konnten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbildung 2: Institutionelle Überschneidungen für alle deutschen Institutionen mit ROR-IDs in fünf Rankingsystemen\n\n\n\nInsgesamt konnten nach dem Abgleich der ROR-IDs 2.928 einzigartige Instiutionen aus Deutschland über alle Rankingsysteme hinweg identifiziert werden. Anhand von Abb. 2 ist zu erkennen, dass das COKI OA Dashboard deutlich mehr deutsche Einrichtungen abbildet, als alle anderen Rankingsysteme, sowohl insgesamt (2.927 Institutionen, 99,97 %), als auch in Bezug auf die Anzahl an Institutionen, die in keinem anderen Rankingsystem abgebildet werden (2.570 Institutionen, 87,77 %). Dies könnte insbesondere darauf zurückzuführen sein, dass das COKI OA Dashboard einerseits einen relativ langen Publikationszeitraum abbildet (2000–2024) und andererseits auch Institutionen aus mehreren Sektoren, sowie Institutionen mit einem relativ geringen Publikationsvolumen von i.d.R. mindestens 50 Publikationen in das Ranking aufnimmt (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c, n.d.-b).\nAbb. 2 zeigt ferner, dass von den 358 aus dem SCImago Institutions Ranking berücksichtigten Institutionen, 1 Institution (0,03 %) in keinem anderen Ranking erfasst ist. Dahingegen werden alle Instiutionen aus beiden Versionen des Leiden Rankings sowie aus dem QS Sustainability Ranking auch in mindestens einem weiteren Ranking abgebildet. Insgesamt sind lediglich 47 Institutionen (1,61 %) in allen fünf Rankingsystemen erfasst.\nWährend das QS Sustainability Ranking sowie beide Versionen des Leiden Ranking lediglich Hochschulen in ihre Rankings einbeziehen, sind im COKI OA Dashboard und dem SCImago Institutions Ranking auch Institutionen aus anderen Sektoren erfasst. Hochschulen werden im COKI-Datensatz mit dem Institutionentyp Education klassifiziert, während im Datensatz des SCImago Institutions Ranking der Sektor Universities für Hochschulen zugewiesen ist. Um folgend die institutionellen Überschneidungen der deutschen Hochschulen zwischen den fünf Rankingsystemen zu untersuchen, wurde im zusammengeführten Datensatz aller Rankingsysteme eine Spalte sector hinzugefügt. Für Einrichtungen, die in beiden Versionen des Leiden Ranking oder im QS Sustainability Ranking abgebildet sind, wurde die Sektorzuordnung Universities ergänzt. Für Einrichtungen, die im SCImago Institutions Ranking oder COKI OA Dashboard abgebildet sind wurde die ursprüngliche Klassifikation beibehalten. Anschließend wurde der Datensatz nach Einrichtungen gefiltert, denen in der sector-Spalte die Werte Universities oder Education zugewiesen waren.\nAbb. 3 stellt folgend die institutionellen Überschneidungen bezogen auf deutsche Hochschulen zwischen den Rankings dar. Die Abbildung bezieht dabei ebenfalls nur diejenigen Institutionen ein, denen ROR-IDs zugeordnet werden konnten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbildung 3: Institutionelle Überschneidungen für deutsche Hochschulen mit ROR-IDs in fünf Rankingsystemen\n\n\n\nInsgesamt konnten 395 verschiedene deutsche Hochschulen über alle Rankingsysteme hinweg identifiziert werden. Abb. 3 zeigt, dass das COKI OA Dashboard auch in Bezug auf die deutschen Hochschulen deutlich mehr Institutionen abbildet, als alle anderen Rankingsysteme, sowohl insgesamt (395 Institutionen, 100 %), als auch in Bezug auf die Anzahl an Institutionen, die in keinem anderen Rankingsystem erfasst sind (287 Institutionen, 72,66 %). Nach Angaben des Statistischen Bundesamt wurden im Wintersemester 2024/2025 insgesamt 422 deutsche Hochschulen gezählt (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2025). Demnach bildet das COKI OA Dashboard nach aktuellem Stand 93,6 % aller deutschen Hochschulen ab. Es ist zudem das einzige Rankingsystem, dass Hochschulen abbildet, die in keinem anderen Ranking erfasst sind. Die absolute Anzahl an deutschen Hochschulen, die in allen fünf Rankingsystemen erfasst sind ist mit 47 Hochschulen unverändert zur absoluten Anzahl aller deutschen Einrichtungen, die in allen fünf Rankingsystemen erfasst sind.\nDas COKI OA Dashboard und das SCImago Institutions Ranking sind die beiden einzigen der untersuchten Rankingsysteme, die nicht nur Hochschulen in ihre Rankings mit einbeziehen. In Bezug auf Deutschland entfallen auf die insgesamt 2.927 deutschen Einrichtungen, die im COKI OA Dashboard abgebildet sind 13,5 % auf deutsche Hochschulen. Im Vergleich entfallen auf die insgesamt 358 deutschen Einrichtungen, die im SCImago Institutions Ranking abgebildet sind, 30,17 % auf deutsche Hochschulen. Für beide Rankingsysteme lässt sich demnach feststellen, dass der Großteil an abgebildeten Einrichtungen, zumindest in Bezug auf Deutschland, anderen Sektoren zugewiesen ist.\n\n\nGeographische Verteilung\nAbbildungen 4 und 55 zeigen folgend die geographische Verteilung der Instiutionen in Bezug auf die Länder und Weltregionen, in denen sie lokalisiert sind. Auch wenn alle fünf Rankings eine globale Ausrichtung haben, soll anhand der Abbildungen visualisiert werden, ob es Unterschiede in der geographischen Verteilung zwischen den Rankings gibt. Um eine bessere Vergleichbarkeit zu gewährleisten wurden für alle Rankingsysteme die Instiutionen auf jene eingeschränkt, die dem Hochschulsektor (Universities, Education) zugeordnet sind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Leiden Ranking 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Leiden Ranking Open Edition 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbildung 4: Geographische Verteilung der in den Leiden Rankings abgebildeten Institutionen auf Länder und Weltregionen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) SCImago Institutions Ranking 2025 (Universities)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) QS Sustainability Ranking 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) COKI OA Dashboard 2025 (Education)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbildung 5: Geographische Verteilung der in den Rankingssystemen SIR, QS und COKI abgebildeten Institutionen auf Länder und Weltregionen\n\n\n\nBetrachtet man die absoluten Anzahlen an Hochschulen, so zeigen Abbildungen 4 und 5 insbesondere, dass für beide Versionen des Leiden Rankings sowie das SCImago Instiutions Ranking die meisten Hochschulen in China ansässig sind (LR: 313 Institutionen, LROE: 313 Institutionen, SIR: 634 Institutionen). Hingegen sind für das QS Sustainability Ranking sowie das COKI OA Dashboard die meisten Institutionen in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika ansässig (QS: 238 Institutionen, COKI: 2688 Institutionen). Ferner verdeutlichen die Abbildungen, dass, mit Ausnahme des COKI OA Dashboards, insbesondere einige Länder aus dem globalen Süden gar nicht in den Rankingsystemen repräsentiert sind.\nZusätzlich zur absoluten Anzahl an Hochschulen soll im Folgenden die relative Verteilung der Hochschulen über Länder und Rankingsysteme hinweg anhand der preference nach Moed (2016) betrachtet werden. Moed (2016) definiert die preference als6:\n\nThe preference of ranking system R for a particular country C is expressed as the ratio of the actual and the expected number of institutions from C appearing in R, where the expected number is based on the total number of institutions across countries and across systems, under the assumption of independence of these two variables. A value of 1.0 indicates that the number of institutions from C in R is ‘as expected’.\n\nDer resultierende Präferenzwert (preference score) misst also, ob ein Land, gemessen an der Anzahl dort ansässiger Institutionen, innerhalb eines Rankingsystems überproportional oder unterproportional repräsentiert ist. Das Maß ist bei einem Wert von 1 neutral, d.h. die Anzahl an Institutionen aus einem Land in einem Rankingsystem entspricht den Erwartungen.

So sind beide Versionen des Leiden Ranking tendenziell auf Europa ausgerichtet, das SCImago Institutions Ranking tendenziell auf Nord- und Südamerika, das COKI OA Dashboard überwiegend auf Asien und Mittelamerika und das QS Sustainability Ranking primär auf Asien. Eine Besonderheit stellt das COKI OA Dashboard dar. Insgesamt weist der COKI Datensatz 68 Länder mit dem selben Präferenzwert von 1,61 auf. Die in Tab. 3 dargestellten Länder sind jene ersten fünf Einträge, die sich aus einer absteigenden Sortierung nach der Anzahl an Institutionen aus den jeweiligen Ländern ergeben. Die Beobachtung, dass eine Vielzahl an Ländern den selben Präferenzwert haben ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass die 68 Länder ausschließlich im COKI OA Dashboard enthalten sind.\nBezogen auf Deutschland zeigt Tab. 3, dass beiden Versionen des Leiden Ranking sowie das QS Sustainability Ranking mit Präferenzwerten von 1,46 und 1,11 eine überproportionale bzw. leicht überproportionale Anzahl an deutschen Hochschulen in ihre Rankings einbeziehen. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass in diesen Rankingsystemen deutsche Hochschulen mit einer absoluten Anzahl von 50 und 57 Hochschulen leicht überrepräsentiert bis überrepräsentiert sind. Hingegen sind im COKI OA Dashboard mit einer absoluten Anzahl von 397 zwar wesentlich mehr deutsche Hochschulen im Ranking enthalten, allerdings zeigt der Präferenzwert von 0.96, dass diese Anzahl unter dem Erwartungswert liegt. Für das SCImago Institutions Ranking beträgt der Präferenzwert für deutsche Hochschulen lediglich 0,82. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass Einrichtungen aus Deutschland in diesem Ranking unterrepräsentiert sind, obwohl die absolute Anzahl an deutschen Hochschulen mit 108 die Zweithöchste ist.\n\n\nInstitutionelle Beteiligung bei der Datenerhebung\nDieser Abschnitt befasst sich mit den Datenerhebungsverfahren der verschiedenen Rankinganbieter und untersucht inwieweit sich Einrichtungen an der sie betreffenden Datenerhebung beteiligen können.\nFür das traditionelle Leiden Ranking erhebt das CWTS keinerlei Daten direkt von den gerankten Einrichtungen (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-a, n.d.-c). Das Ranking basiert auf Daten aus dem Web of Science, die vom CWTS aufbereitet und standardisiert werden. Da es sich beim Web of Science jedoch um eine proprietäre Datenquelle handelt, die mit lizenzrechtlichen Restriktionen einhergeht, ist es dem CWTS nicht möglich die Rohdaten sowie die kuratierten Daten offen zugänglich zu machen (van Eck, Visser, et al., 2024). Dadurch ist es den betreffenden Einrichtungen nicht ohne Weiteres möglich die Datenqualität zu überprüfen.\nFür das Leiden Ranking Open Edition werden ebenfalls keine Daten direkt bei den Einrichtungen erhoben (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b). Im Gegensatz zum traditionellen Leiden Ranking greift das Leiden Ranking Open Edition jedoch auf offene Datenquellen, wie OpenAlex und ROR, zur Erstellung des Rankings zurück (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-b). Durch die Verwendung von offenen Datenquellen und aufgrund der Bereitstellung der Roh- und Ergebnisdaten durch das CWTS (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, n.d.-d) ist es den gerankten Einrichtungen möglich, einerseits die Qualität der Daten zu überprüfen und andererseits am Datenkurierungsprozess teilzunehmen, indem die Einrichtungen Probleme mit der Datenqualität an die jeweiligen Akteure melden (van Eck, Visser, et al., 2024).\nDie Methodik des SCImago Institutions Rankings beschreibt, dass für das Ranking Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen erhoben werden, dies sind: Scopus, PATSTAT, Google, Semrush, Unpaywall, PlumX Metrics, Mendeley und Overton (SCImago Research Group, n.d.-a). Die Methodik erwähnt keine Möglichkeit der institutionellen Beteiligung bei der Datenerhebung, weshalb davon ausgegangen wird, dass keine Daten direkt von den gerankten Institutionen erhoben werden. Die bibliographischen Daten für das SCImago Institutions Ranking stammen aus Scopus, einer proprietären Datenquelle, die, ähnlich wie das Web of Science, mit lizenzrechtlichen Einschränkungen einhergeht. Die Rohdaten des SCImago Institutions Ranking sind nicht öffentlich zugänglich, wodurch davon auszugehen ist, dass gerankte Institutionen nicht ohne Weiteres die Möglichkeit haben, die sie betreffenden Daten zu überprüfen oder zu korrigieren, bevor sie in das Ranking einbezogen werden. Zur Bestimmung des Open-Access-Status verwendet das SCImago Institutions Ranking mit Unpaywall eine offene Datenquelle. Ähnlich wie beim Leiden Ranking Open Edition könnte für die Open-Access-Daten eine Beteiligung der betreffenden Einrichtungen am Datenkuratierungsprozess möglich sein, indem Probleme mit der Datenqualität direkt an Unpaywall gemeldet werden. Insgesamt weist die Methodik des SCImago Institutions Ranking wenig Informationen bezüglich Datenqualität und mögliche Einschränkungen auf, es wird auch nicht transparent kommuniziert, welche Möglichkeiten es für Einrichtungen gibt zu einer verbesserten Datenqualität beizutragen.\nDie COKI Open Access Dashboard verwendet zur Datenerhebung ausschließlich offene Datenquellen, darunter Crossref, Unpaywall, oder ROR (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c). Die Methodik des COKI OA Dashboard beschreibt detailliert den Prozess der Datenerhebung anhand externer Datenquellen, macht jedoch keine Angaben zu einer Datenlieferung durch die gerankten Institutionen selbst (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c). Es ist daher davon auszugehen, dass es keine direkte institutionelle Beteiligung bei der Datenerhebung gibt. Da der COKI-Datensatz auf offenen Datenquellen basiert, ist ähnlich wie beim Leiden Ranking Open Edition davon auszugehen, dass die betreffenden Institutionen die Möglichkeit haben sich indirekt am Datenkuratierungsprozess zu beteiligen, indem sie Probleme mit der Datenqualität direkt an die jeweiligen Verantwortlichen der verschiedenen Datenquellen melden. Darüber hinaus kommuniziert COKI Limitationen des eigenen Datensatzes (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-c) und bietet verschiedene Kontaktmöglichkeiten (Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, n.d.-a), sodass Einrichtungen auch die Möglichkeit haben, aktiv an der Verbesserung der Daten des COKI-Datensatzes mitzuwirken.\nDas QS Sustainability Ranking ist das einzige der fünf untersuchten Rankingsysteme, dass eine direkte Beteiligung der betreffenden Institutionen bei der Datenerhebung vorsieht. Die Methodik des QS Sustainability Ranking beschreibt, dass QS generell alle Institutionen ermutigt, Daten für die QS Rankings bereitzustellen (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-g). Zur Datenübermittlung stellt QS eine spezielle Plattform bereit, die Methodik bietet jedoch keine genaue Auflistung, welche Daten erfragt werden (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-g). Sollten Institutionen, die für die Aufnahme in das QS Sustainability Ranking qualifiziert sind keine Daten liefern, so bewertet QS diese Institutionen auf Grundlage von proprietären und öffentlich verfügbaren Daten oder zuvor von der jeweiligen Einrichtung bereitgestellten Daten. Ein gänzliches opt-out aus dem Ranking von institutioneller Seite ist demnach nicht vorgesehen. QS argumentiert dies damit, dass die Inklusion aller qualifizierenden Einrichtungen die Zuverlässigkeit der Rankings erhöht (Quacquarelli Symonds, n.d.-c). Allerdings bietet QS keine Angaben dazu, wie viele der gerankten Einrichtungen tatsächlich die Möglichkeit zur Datenlieferung wahrnehmen.\nInsgesamt zeigt sich, dass die Möglichkeit für Einrichtungen, sich an der sie betreffenden Datenerhebung der Rankinganbieter zu beteiligen, nur begrenzt gegeben ist. Das QS Sustainability Ranking ist das einzige Rankingsystem, das direkt Daten von den betreffenden Institutionen erhebt, wobei nicht ganz klar ist, welche spezifischen Daten von den Einrichtungen abgefragt werden. Die anderen Rankingsysteme verwenden ausschließlich Daten aus externen Quellen, die nicht direkt von den Institutionen erhoben werden. Die Verwendung von offenen Datenquellen, wie im Leiden Ranking Open Edition oder dem COKI OA Dashboard, kann jedoch den Einrichtungen eine Möglichkeit bieten, die Qualität der sie betreffenden Daten zu verbessern. Qualitativ hochwertige Quelldaten, sowie transparente Methodiken für die Erstellung von Rankings können ferner dazu beitragen das Vertrauen in Verlässlichkeit und Aussagekraft der Rankingsysteme zu verbessern."

    "text": "Beschreibung\nDie Carpentries (bestehend aus Data, Library und Software Carpentry) sind eine Methode, in grundlegende Datenkompentenzen einzuführen. Hauptaugenmerk liegt dabei auf dem gemeinschaftlichen Erlernen IT-gestützter Verfahren zur Lösung praktischer Probleme. In Deutschland unterstützen sowohl bibliothekarische Fachverbände als auch wissenschaftliche Einrichtungen die Carpentries-Community über eine Mitgliedschaft. So ist die SUB Göttingen seit 2019 Mitglied und bildet am Campus Göttingen jährlich bis zu fünf Instruktoren aus und organisiert regelmäßig Carpentries Workshops, die in erster Linie Nachwuchswissenschaftler:innen und Bibliothekar:innen adressieren. Ziel des AP ist es, Trainings mit spezifischem Fokus auf die Datenpraxis zur Gestaltung der OA- Transformation als Teil von Library Carpentry zu entwerfen, zu testen und iterativ weiterzuentwickeln. Die Zielgruppe umfasst Professionals des Bereichs OA-Transformation und Forschungsadministration. Innerhalb eines Carpentry-Trainings lassen sich nicht sämtliche datenanalytische Aspekte abdecken. Vielmehr geht es darum, offene und wissenschaftsnahe Tools und Vorgehensweisen einzuführen und deren Anwendung zu erproben (Wilson et al., 2017). Die Aufgaben des AP orientieren sich an dem Lebenszyklus der Carpentries Lessons und starten im 2. Projektjahr."

    "text": "Beschreibung\nIn der Digital-Strategie des Bundesministeriums für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) heißt es: „Bis zum Jahr 2025 werden 70 Prozent aller neu erscheinenden wissenschaftlichen Publikationen in Deutschland ausschließlich oder zusätzlich im Wege des Open Access veröffentlicht.“ (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, 2019, S. 37). Über diese nationale OA-Zielmarke hinaus haben einzelne Bundesländer spezifische OA-Zielmarken definiert. Im „Monitoring-Bericht 2019“ des Paktes für Forschung und Innovation (PFI) der Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz (GWK) betonen Bund und Länder die Notwendigkeit „durchgängige und vergleichbare Erhebungen zu Open-Access-Publikationen“ (Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz, 2019, S. 16) zu etablieren. In einem 2022 veröffentlichten Diskussionspapier der AG Wissenschaftliches Publikationssystem in der Schwerpunktinitiative „Digitale Information“ der Allianz wird ein erster Vorschlag für eine gemeinsame Indikatorik zu OA für Deutschland formuliert (Deinzer et al., 2022). Problem dieses Vorschlags ist, dass er bisher nicht über die AG hinaus diskutiert wurde.\nDas AP 4 setzt auf dieser Arbeit - an der ein Antragsteller als Leiter der zuständigen Task Group der AG Wissenschaftliches Publikationssystem beteiligt war - auf und organisiert auf Basis des Diskussionspapiers einen Dialog zur Weiterentwicklung dieses Vorschlags. Ziel ist es, einen nationalen Standard zur Definition von OA für das Reporting und eine damit verbundene Erhebungspraxis."

Hierzu wird ein zielgruppenspezifischer Blick auf Professionals eingenommen, die sich auf Basis von Publikations- und Kostendaten mit der OA-Transformation in operativen und strategischen Bereichen wissenschaftlicher Einrichtungen befassen. Im Fokus steht dabei das Personal in Administration und Bibliothek an Hochschulen und außeruniversitären Einrichtungen. Dies sind u.a. Professionals in den Bereichen Digitales Publizieren, OA, Erwerbung und Bestandsentwicklung, Forschungsinformation sowie Forschungsförderung.\nAuf Basis einer Stakeholder-Analyse (T1.1) wird der Informationsbedarf, der Umgang mit Datenquellen sowie die Interdependenz rund um Datenanalysen im Kontext der OA-Transformation an wissenschaftlichen Einrichtungen erhoben (T1.2). Hierbei wird auch das Potenzial der sich im Aufbau befindlichen Monitoringsysteme zu Open Science betrachtet. Mit der so erzielten Bestandsaufnahme (T1.3), die die spezifischen Praktiken im Umgang mit Daten zu OA und zukünftigen Anforderungen der Agierenden betrachtet, wird die Grundlage für Empfehlungen zum Thema geschaffen (AP 5)."
